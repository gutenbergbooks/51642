<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FACE IN THE TAXI</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">HIS “Business Ambassador” was the title
which my old chief, Ezekiel Coldston, used
to give me. I daresay that it served as
well as any other to describe with a pleasant mixture
of dignity and playfulness, the sort of glorified bag-man
or drummer that I was. It was my job to go
into all quarters of the earth where the old man had
scented a concession or a contract&mdash;and what a
nose he had for them!&mdash;and make it appear to powerful
persons that the Coldston firm would pay more
for the concession (more in the long run, at all
events) or ask less for the contract (less in the first
instance, at all events) than any other responsible
firm, company, or corporation in the world. Sir
Ezekiel (as in due course he became) took me from
a very low rung of the regular diplomatic ladder
into his service on the recommendation of my uncle,
Sir Paget Rillington, who was then at the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
that same ladder. My employer was good enough
to tell me more than once that I had justified the
recommendation.</p>

<p>“You’ve excellent manners, Julius,” he told me.
“Indeed, quite engaging. Plenty of tact! You work&mdash;fairly
hard; your gift for languages is of a great
value, and, if you have no absolute genius for business&mdash;well,
I’m at the other end of the cable. I’ve
no cause to be dissatisfied.”</p>

<p>“As much as you could expect of the public school
and varsity brand, sir?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“More,” said Ezekiel decisively.</p>

<p>I liked the job. I was very well paid. I saw the
world; I met all sorts of people; and I was always
royally treated, since, if I was always trying to get
on the right side of my business or political friends,
they were equally anxious to get on the right side of
me&mdash;which meant, in their sanguine imaginations,
the right side of Sir Ezekiel; a position which I believe
to correspond rather to an abstract mathematical
conception than to anything actually realizable in
experience.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to talk about all that. I
mention the few foregoing circumstances only to account
for the fact that I found myself in town in the
summer of 1914, back from a long and distant excursion,
temporary occupant of a furnished flat (I was
a homeless creature) in Buckingham Gate, enjoying
the prospect of a few months’ holiday, and desirous
of picking up the thread of my family and social connections&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
with an eye to country house visits
and a bit of shooting or fishing by and by. First of
all, though, after a short spell of London, I was due
at Cragsfoot, to see Sir Paget, tell him about my
last trip, and console him for the loss of Waldo’s
society.</p>

<p>Not that anything tragic had happened to Waldo.
On the contrary, he was going to be married. I
had heard of the engagement a month before I sailed
from Buenos Aires, and the news had sent my
thoughts back to an autumn stay at Cragsfoot two
years before, with Sir Paget and old Miss Fleming
(we were great friends, she and I); the two boys,
Waldo and Arsenio, just down from Oxford; respectable
Mrs. Knyvett&mdash;oh, most indubitably respectable
Mrs. Knyvett;&mdash;myself, older than the
boys, younger than the seniors, and so with an agreeable
alternation of atmosphere offered to me&mdash;and
Lucinda! True that Nina Frost was a good deal
there too, coming over from that atrocious big villa
along the coast&mdash;Briarmount they called it&mdash;still,
she was not of the house party; there was always
a last talk, or frolic, after Nina had gone home, and
after Mrs. Knyvett had gone to bed. Miss Fleming,
“Aunt Bertha,” liked talks and frolics; and
Sir Paget was popularly believed not to go to bed at
all; he used to say that he had got out of the habit
in Russia. So it was a merry time&mdash;a merry,
thoughtless&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>Why, no, not the least thoughtless. I had nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
fallen into a <i>cliché</i>, a spurious commonplace. Youth
may not count and calculate. It thinks like the deuce&mdash;and
is not ashamed to talk its thoughts right out.
You remember the Oxford talk, any of you who
have been there, not (with submission to critics) all
about football and the Gaiety, but through half the
night about the Trinity, or the Nature of the Absolute,
or Community of Goods, or why in Tennyson (this
is my date rather than Waldo’s) Arthur
had no children by Guinevere, or whether the working
classes ought to limit&mdash;well, and so on. The
boys brought us all that atmosphere, if not precisely
those topics, and mighty were the discussions,&mdash;with
Sir Paget to whet the blades, if ever they grew blunt,
with one of his aphorisms, and Aunt Bertha to round
up a discussion with an anecdote.</p>

<p>And now Lucinda had accepted Waldo! They
were to be married now&mdash;directly. She had settled
in practice the problem we had once debated through
a moonlight evening on the terrace that looked out
to sea. At what age should man and woman marry?
He at thirty, she at twenty-five, said one side&mdash;in
the interest of individual happiness. He at twenty-one,
she at eighteen, said the other, in the interest
of social wellbeing. (Mrs. Knyvett had gone to
bed.) Lucinda was now twenty-one and Waldo
twenty-six. It was a compromise&mdash;though, when I
come to think of it, she had taken no part in discussing
the problem. “I should do as I felt,” had
been her one and only contribution; and she also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
went to bed in the early stages of the wordy battle.
Incidentally I may observe that Lucinda’s exits were
among the best things that she did&mdash;yes, even in
those early days, when they were all instinct and no
art. From Sir Paget downwards we men felt that,
had the problem been set for present solution, we
should all have felt poignantly interested in what
Lucinda felt that she would do. No man of sensibility&mdash;as
they used to say before we learnt really
colloquial English&mdash;could have felt otherwise.</p>

<p>I will not run on with these recollections just now,
but I was chuckling over them on the morning of
Waldo’s and Lucinda’s wedding day&mdash;a very fine
day in July, on which, after late and leisurely breakfast,
I looked across the road on the easy and scattered
activity of the barracks’ yard. That scene was
soon to change&mdash;but the future wore its veil. With
a mind vacant of foreboding, I was planning only
how to spend the time till half-past two. I decided
to dress myself, go to the club, read the papers,
lunch, and so on to St. George’s. For, of course, St.
George’s it was to be. Mrs. Knyvett had a temporary
flat in Mount Street; Sir Paget had no town
house, but put up at Claridge’s; he and Waldo&mdash;and
Aunt Bertha&mdash;had been due to arrive there from
Cragsfoot yesterday. Perhaps it was a little curious
that Waldo had not been in town for the last week;
but he had not, and I had seen none of the Cragsfoot
folk since I got home. I had left a card on Mrs.
Knyvett, but&mdash;well, I suppose that she and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
daughter were much too busy to take any notice. I
am afraid that I was rather glad of it; apprehensive
visions of a <i>partie carrée</i>&mdash;the lovers mutually
absorbed, and myself left to engross Mrs. Knyvett&mdash;faded
harmlessly into the might-have-beens.</p>

<p>I walked along the Mall, making for my club in
St. James’s Street. At the corner by Marlborough
House I had to wait before crossing the road; a
succession of motors and taxis held me up. I was still
thinking of Lucinda; at least I told myself a moment
later that I must have been still thinking of
Lucinda, because only in that way could I account,
on rational lines, for what happened to me. It was
one o’clock&mdash;the Palace clock had just struck. The
wedding was at half-past two, and the bride was,
beyond reasonable doubt, now being decked out for
it, or, perchance, taking necessary sustenance. But
not driving straight away from the scene of operations,
not looking out of the window of that last taxi
which had just whisked by me! Yet the face at the
taxi window&mdash;I could have sworn it was Lucinda’s.
It wore her smile&mdash;and not many faces did that.
Stranger still, it dazzled with that vivid flush which
she herself&mdash;the real Lucinda&mdash;exhibited only on
the rarest occasions, the moments of high feeling.
It had come on the evening when Waldo and Arsenio
Valdez quarreled at Cragsfoot.</p>

<p>The vision came and went, but left me strangely
taken aback, in a way ashamed of myself, feeling a
fool. I shrugged my shoulders angrily as I crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Pall Mall. As I reached the pavement on the other
tide, I took out my cigarette case; I wanted to be
normal and reasonable; I would smoke.</p>

<p>“Take a light from mine, Julius,” said a smooth
and dainty voice.</p>

<p>It may seem absurd&mdash;an affectation of language&mdash;to
call a voice “dainty,” but the epithet is really
appropriate to Arsenio Valdez’s way of talking,
whether in Spanish, Italian, or English. As was
natural, he spoke them all with equal ease and mastery,
but he used none of them familiarly; each was
treated as an art, not in the choice of words&mdash;that
would be tedious in every-day life&mdash;but in articulation.
We others used often to chaff him about it,
but he always asserted that it was the “note of a
Castilian.”</p>

<p>There he stood, at the bottom corner of St.
James’s Street, neat, cool, and trim as usual&mdash;like
myself, he was wearing a wedding garment&mdash;and
looking his least romantic and his most monkeyish:
he could do wonders in either direction.</p>

<p>“Hullo! what tree have you dropped from, Monkey?”
I asked. But then I went on, without waiting
for an answer. “I say, that taxi must have passed
you too, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“A lot of taxis have been passing. Which one?”</p>

<p>“The one with the girl in it&mdash;the girl like Lucinda.
Didn’t you see her?”</p>

<p>“I never saw a girl like Lucinda&mdash;except Lucinda
herself. Have you lunched? No, I mean the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
question quite innocently, old chap. Because, if you
haven’t, we might together. Of course you’re
bound for the wedding as I am? At least, I can
just manage, if the bride’s punctual. I’ve got an
appointment that I must keep at three-fifteen.”</p>

<p>“That gives you time enough. Come and have
lunch with me at White’s.” I put my arm in his
and we walked up the street. I forgot my little
excitement over the girl in the cab.</p>

<p>Though he was a pure-blooded Spaniard, though
he had been educated at Beaumont and Christ
Church, Valdez was more at home in Italy than
anywhere else. His parents had settled there, in
the train of the exiled Don Carlos, and the son still
owned a small <i>palazzo</i> at Venice and derived the
bulk of his means (or so I understood) from letting
the more eligible floors of it, keeping the attics for
himself. Here he consorted with wits, poets, and
“Futurists,” writing a bit himself&mdash;Italian was the
language he employed for his verses&mdash;till he wanted
a change, when he would shoot off to the Riviera, or
Spain, or Paris, or London, as the mood took him.
But he had not been to England for nearly two years
now; he gave me to understand that the years of
education had given him, for the time, a surfeit of
my native land: not a surprising thing, perhaps.</p>

<p>“So I lit out soon after our stay at Cragsfoot, and
didn’t come back again till a fortnight ago, when
some business brought me over. And I’m off again
directly, in a day or two at longest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lucky you’ve hit the wedding. I suppose you
haven’t seen anything of my folks then&mdash;or of the
Knyvetts?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen Waldo or Sir Paget, but I’ve
been seeing something of Mrs. Knyvett and Lucinda
since I got here. And they were out in Venice last
autumn; and, as they took an apartment in my house,
I saw a good deal of them there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t know they’d been to Venice. Nobody
ever writes to tell me anything when I’m
away.”</p>

<p>“Poor old chap! Get a wife, and she’ll write to
tell you she’s in debt. I say, oughtn’t we to be
moving? It won’t look well to be late, you know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be fidgety. We’ve got half an hour, and
it’s not above ten minutes’ walk.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be a squash, and I want a good place.
Come on, Julius.” He rose from the table rather
abruptly; indeed, with an air of something like impatience
or irritation.</p>

<p>“Hang it! you might be going to be married
yourself, you’re in such a hurry,” I said, as I finished
my glass of brandy.</p>

<p>As we walked, Valdez was silent. I looked at
his profile; the delicate fine lines were of a poet’s,
or what a poet’s should be to our fancy.
Not so much as a touch of the monkey! That
touch, indeed, when it did come, came on the lips;
and it came seldom. It was the devastating acumen
and the ruthless cruelty of boyhood that had winged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the shaft of his school nickname. Yet it had followed
him to the varsity; it followed him now; I
myself often called him by it. “Monkey Valdez”!
Not pretty, you know. It did not annoy him in the
least. He thought it just insular; possibly that is
all it was. But such persistence is some evidence of
a truthfulness in it.</p>

<p>“Have you been trying a fall with Dame Fortune
lately?” I asked.</p>

<p>He turned his face to me, smiling. “I’m a reformed
character. At least, I was till a fortnight
ago. I hadn’t touched a card or seen a table for
above a year. Seemed not to want to! A great
change, eh? But I didn’t miss it. Then when&mdash;when
I decided to come over here, I thought I would
go round by the Riviera, and just get out at Monte
Carlo, and have a shot&mdash;between trains, you know.
I wanted to see if my luck was in. So I got off, had
lunch, and walked into the rooms. I backed my
number everyway I could&mdash;<i>en plein</i>, <i>impair</i>, all the
rest. I stood to win about two hundred louis.”</p>

<p>“Lost, of course?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. I won.”</p>

<p>“And then lost?”</p>

<p>“No. I pouched the lot and caught my train.
I wasn’t going to spoil the omen.” He was smiling
now&mdash;very contentedly.</p>

<p>“What was the number?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one.”</p>

<p>“This is the twenty-first of July,” I observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gamblers must be guided by something, some
fancy, some omen,” he said. “I had just heard that
Waldo and Lucinda were to be married on the
twenty-first.”</p>

<p>The monkey did peep out for a moment then; but
we were already in George Street; the church was in
sight, and my attention was diverted. “Better for
you if you’d lost,” I murmured carelessly.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, dull prudence!” he said mockingly.
“But&mdash;the sensation! I can feel it now!”</p>

<p>We were on the other side of the road from
the church, but almost opposite to it, as he spoke,
and it was only then that I noticed anything peculiar.
The first thing which I marked was an unusual
animation in the usual small crowd of the
“general public” clustered on either side of the
steps: they were talking a lot to one another. Still
more peculiar was the fact that all the people in
carriages and cars seemed to have made a mistake;
they drew up for a moment before the entrance;
a beadle, or some official of that semi-ecclesiastical
order, said something to them, and
they moved on again&mdash;nobody got out! To crown
it, a royal brougham drove up&mdash;every Londoner
can tell one yards away, if it were only by the
horses&mdash;and stopped. My uncle, Sir Paget himself,
came down the steps, took off his tall hat,
and put his head in at the carriage window for a
moment; then he signed, and no doubt spoke, to
the footman, who had not even jumped down from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the box or taken off his hat. And the royal brougham
drove on.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned!” said I.</p>

<p>Valdez jerked his head in a quick sideways nod.
“Something wrong? Looks like it!”</p>

<p>I crossed the road quickly, and he kept pace
with me. My intention was to join Sir Paget, but
that beadle intercepted us.</p>

<p>“Wedding’s unavoidably postponed, gentlemen,”
he said. “Sudden indisposition of the bride.”</p>

<p>There it was! I turned to Valdez in dismay&mdash;with
a sudden, almost comical, sense of being let
down, choused, made a fool of. “Well, twenty-one’s
not been a lucky number for poor Lucinda,
at all events!” I said&mdash;rather pointlessly; but his
story had been running in my head.</p>

<p>He made no direct reply; a little shrug seemed
at once to accuse and to accept destiny. “Sir Paget’s
beckoning to you,” he said. “Do you think I might
come too?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, my dear fellow. We both want
to know what’s wrong, don’t we?”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SIGNAL</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">BY now it was past the half-hour; the arrivals
dwindled to a few late stragglers, who were
promptly turned away by the beadle; the
crowd of onlookers dispersed with smiles, shrugs,
and a whistle or two: only a group of reporters stood
on the lowest step, talking to one another and glancing
at Sir Paget, as though they would like to tackle
him but were doubtful of their reception. One did
quietly detach himself from the group and walked
up to where my uncle stood on the top step. I saw
Sir Paget raise his hat, bow slightly, and speak one
sentence. The man bowed in return, and rejoined
his fellows with a rueful smile; then all of them
made off together down the street.</p>

<p>My uncle was a little below middle height, but
very upright and spare, so that he looked taller than
he was. He had large features&mdash;a big, high-peaked
nose, wide, thin-lipped mouth, bushy eyebrows, and
very keen blue eyes. He bore himself with marked
dignity&mdash;even with some stiffness towards the world
at large, although among intimates he was the most
urbane and accessible of men. His long experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in affairs had given him imperturbable composure;
even at this moment he did not look the least put
out. His manner and speech were modeled on the
old school of public men&mdash;formal and elaborate
when the occasion demanded, but easy, offhand, and
familiar in private: to hear him was sometimes like
listening to behind-the-scenes utterances of, say, Lord
Melbourne or the great Duke which have come down
to us in memoirs of their period.</p>

<p>When we went up to him, he nodded to me and
gave his hand to Valdez. He had not seen him for
two years, but he only said, “Ah, you here, Arsenio?”
and went on, “Well, boys, here’s a damned
kettle of fish! The girl’s cut and run, by Gad, she
has!”</p>

<p>Valdez muttered “Good Lord!” or “Good Heavens!”
or something of that kind. I found nothing
to say, but the face I had seen at the taxi window
flashed before my eyes again.</p>

<p>“Went out at ten this morning&mdash;for a walk, she
said, before dressing. And she never came back.
Half an hour ago a boy-messenger left a note for
her mother. ‘I can’t do it, Mother. So I’ve gone.’&mdash;That
was all. Aunt Bertha had been called in to
assist at the dressing-up, and she sent word to me.
Mrs. Knyvett collapsed, of course.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and Waldo? Is he here?” asked Valdez.
“I’d like to see him and&mdash;and say what I could.”</p>

<p>“I got him away by the back door&mdash;to avoid those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
press fellows: he consented to go back to the hotel
and wait for me there.”</p>

<p>“It’s a most extraordinary thing,” said Valdez,
who wore an air of embarrassment quite natural
under the circumstances. He was&mdash;or had been&mdash;an
intimate of the family; but this was an extremely
intimate family affair. “I called in Mount Street
three days ago,” he went on, “and she seemed quite&mdash;well,
normal, you know; very bright and happy,
and all that.”</p>

<p>Sir Paget did not speak. Valdez looked at his
watch. “Well, you’ll want to be by yourselves, and
I’ve got an appointment.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, my boy. You must come and see us
presently. You’re looking very well, Arsenio.
Good-by. Don’t you go, Julius, I want you.”</p>

<p>Arsenio walked down the steps very quickly&mdash;indeed,
he nearly ran&mdash;and got into a taxi which was
standing by the curb. He turned and waved his
hand towards us as he got in. My uncle was frowning
and pursing up his thin, supple lips. He took my
arm and we came down the steps together.</p>

<p>“There’s the devil to pay with Waldo,” he said,
pressing his hand on my sleeve. “It was all I could
do to make him promise to wait till we’d talked it
over.”</p>

<p>“What does he want to do?”</p>

<p>“He’s got one of his rages. You know ‘em?
They don’t come often, but when they do&mdash;well, it’s
damned squally weather! And he looks on her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as good as his wife, you see.” He glanced up at
me&mdash;I am a good deal the taller&mdash;with a very unwonted
look of distress and apprehension. “He’s
not master of himself. It would never do for him
to go after them in the state he’s in now.”</p>

<p>“After&mdash;<i>them?</i>”</p>

<p>“That’s his view; I incline to it myself, too.”</p>

<p>“She was alone in the taxi.” I blurted it out,
more to myself than to him, and quite without thinking.</p>

<p>I told him of my encounter; it had seemed a delusion,
but need not seem so now.</p>

<p>“Driving past Marlborough House into the
Mall? Looks like Victoria, doesn’t it? Any luggage
on the cab?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re an infernal fool, Julius,” said Sir
Paget peevishly.</p>

<p>I was not annoyed, though I felt sure that my
uncle himself would have thought no more about
luggage than I had, if he had seen the face as I had
seen it. But I felt shy about describing the flush on
a girl’s face and the sparkle in her eyes; that was
more Valdez’s line of country than mine. So I said
nothing, and we fell into a dreary silence which lasted
till we got to the hotel.</p>

<p>I went upstairs behind Sir Paget in some trepidation.
I had, for years back, heard of Waldo’s
“white rages”; I had seen only one, and I had not
liked it. Waldo was not, to my thinking, a Rillington:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
we are a dark, spare race. He was a Fleming&mdash;stoutly
built, florid and rather ruddy in the face.
But the passion seemed to suck up his blood; it turned
him white. It was rather curious and uncanny, while
it lasted. The poor fellow used to be very much
ashamed of himself when it was over; but while it
was on&mdash;well, he did not seem to be ashamed of
anything he did or said. He was dangerous&mdash;to
himself and others. Really, that night at Cragsfoot,
I had thought that he was going to knock Valdez’s
head off, though the ostensible cause of quarrel
was nothing more serious&mdash;or perhaps I should say
nothing less abstract&mdash;than the Legitimist principle,
of which Valdez, true to his paternal tradition,
elected to pose as the champion and brought on himself
a bitter personal attack, in which such words as
hypocrites, parasites, flunkeys, toadeaters, etc., etc.,
figured vividly. And all this before the ladies, and
in the presence of his father, whose absolute authority
over him he was at all normal moments eager to
acknowledge.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell him that you think you saw her
this morning,” said Sir Paget, pausing outside the
door of the room. “He has a right to know; and
it’s not enough really to give him any clew that might
be&mdash;well, too easy!” My uncle gave me a very wry
smile as he spoke.</p>

<p>Waldo was older now; perhaps he had greater
self-control, perhaps the magnitude of his disaster
forbade any fretful exhibition of fury. It was a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
rage&mdash;indeed, he was pale as a ghost&mdash;but he was
quiet; the lightning struck inwards. He received
his father’s assurance that everything had been managed
as smoothly as possible&mdash;with the minimum of
publicity&mdash;without any show of interest; he was beyond
caring about publicity or ridicule, I think. On
the other hand, it may be that these things held too
high a place in Sir Paget’s mind; he almost suggested
that, if the thing could be successfully hushed
up, it would be much the same as if it had never
happened: perhaps the diplomatic instinct sets that
way. Waldo’s concern stood rooted in the thing
itself. This is not to say that his pride was not hit,
as well as his love; but it was the blow that hurt
him, not the noise that the blow might make.</p>

<p>Probably Sir Paget saw this for himself before
many minutes had passed; for he turned to me, saying,
“You’d better tell him your story, for what it’s
worth, Julius.”</p>

<p>Waldo listened to me with a new look of alertness,
but the story seemed to come to less than he
had expected. His interest flickered out again, and
he listened with an impatient frown to Sir Paget’s
conjectures as to the fugitive’s destination. But he
put two or three questions to me.</p>

<p>“Did she recognize you? See you, I mean&mdash;bow,
or nod, or anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all; I don’t think she saw me. She
passed me in a second, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“It must have been Lucinda, of course. You
couldn’t have been mistaken?”</p>

<p>“I thought I was at the time, because it seemed
impossible. Of course, now&mdash;as things stand&mdash;there’s
no reason why it shouldn’t have been Lucinda,
and no doubt it was.”</p>

<p>“How was she looking?”</p>

<p>I had to attempt that description, after all! “Very
animated; very&mdash;well, eager, you know. She was
flushed; she looked&mdash;well, excited.”</p>

<p>“You’re dead sure that she was alone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m positive as to that.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t help us much,” observed Sir
Paget. “Even if anything could help us! For the
present I think I shouldn’t mention it to any one
else&mdash;except, of course, Mrs. Knyvett and Aunt Bertha.
No more talk of any kind than we can help!”</p>

<p>“Besides you two, I’ve only mentioned it to Valdez;
and, when I did that, I didn’t believe that the
girl was Lucinda.”</p>

<p>“Monkey Valdez! Did he come to the&mdash;to the
church?” Waldo asked quickly. “I didn’t know
he was in London, or even in England.”</p>

<p>“He’s been in town about a fortnight, I gathered.
He’d seen the Knyvetts, he said, and I suppose they
asked him to the wedding.”</p>

<p>“You met him there&mdash;and told him about this&mdash;this
seeing Lucinda?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t meet him at the church. He lunched
with me before and we walked there together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, only some half-joking remark that you
couldn’t take any other girl for Lucinda. He
didn’t seem to attach any importance to it.”</p>

<p>Waldo’s eyes were now set steadily on my face.
“Did you tell him at lunch, or as you walked to the
church, or at the church?”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, before lunch. I mentioned
the matter&mdash;that was half in joke too&mdash;as soon as I
met him in the street.”</p>

<p>Sir Paget was about to speak, but Waldo silenced
him imperiously. “Half a minute, Father. I want
to know about this. Where did you meet&mdash;and
when?”</p>

<p>“As soon as the taxi&mdash;the one with the girl in it&mdash;had
gone by. I had to wait for it to go by. I
crossed over to St. James’s Street and stopped to
light a cigarette. Just as I was getting out a match,
he spoke to me.”</p>

<p>“Where did he come from?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I didn’t see him till he spoke to
me.”</p>

<p>“He might have been standing at the corner there&mdash;or
near it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for all I know&mdash;or just have reached there,
or just crossed from the other corner of St. James’s
Street. I really don’t know. Why does it matter,
Waldo?”</p>

<p>“You’re dense, man, you’re dense!”</p>

<p>“Gently, Waldo, old boy!” Sir Paget interposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
softly. He was standing with his back to the fireplace,
smoking cigarette after cigarette, but quite
quietly, not in a fluster. It was plain that he had
begun to follow the scent which Waldo was pursuing
so keenly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Julius. But look here. If
he was at either corner of the street, or on the refuge
in the middle&mdash;there is one, I think&mdash;he may
well have been there a moment before&mdash;standing
there, waiting perhaps. The taxi that passed you
would have passed him. He would have seen the
girl just as you saw her.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, that’s true! But he’d have told me if
he had.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say he hadn’t?”</p>

<p>I searched my memory. “No, he didn’t say that.
But if&mdash;well, if, as you seem to suggest, he was
there in order to see her, and did see her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was funny enough your happening to see her.
It would be a lot funnier coincidence if he just
happened to be there, and just happened to see her
too! And just as funny if he was there and didn’t
see her, eh?”</p>

<p>“But how could he carry it off as he did?”</p>

<p>“My dear chap, the Monkey would carry off a
load of bricks that hit him on the head! There’s
nothing in that.”</p>

<p>“What’s your theory, Waldo?” Sir Paget asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Waldo sat silent for a full minute. He seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
by now to be over the first fit of his rage; there
was color in his cheeks again. But his eyes were
bright, intent, and hard. He seemed to be piecing
together the theory for which his father asked him&mdash;piecing
it together so as to give it to us in a complete
form. Waldo was not quick-witted, but he
had a good brain. If he got hold of a problem, he
would worry it to a solution.</p>

<p>“I’ve written to her every day,” he began slowly.
“And she’s answered, quite affectionately&mdash;she’s
never offensive; she’s given me no hint that she
meant to go back on me like this. The day before
yesterday I wired to her to know if I might come
up; she wired: ‘For pity’s sake don’t. I am too
busy. Wait till the day.’”</p>

<p>“Nothing much in that,” said his father. “She’d
put it that way&mdash;playfully.”</p>

<p>“Nothing much if it stood alone,” Waldo agreed.
“But suppose she was struggling between two influences&mdash;mine
and his.” For a moment his voice faltered.
“He’s always been against me&mdash;always&mdash;ever
since that time at Cragsfoot.” I heard a swallow
in his throat, and he went on again steadily.
“Never mind that. Look at it as a case, a problem,
impersonally. A girl is due to marry a man; another
is besieging her. She can’t make up her mind&mdash;can’t
make it up even on the very day before the wedding;
or, if you like, won’t admit to herself that she has
really resolved to break her promise, to be false to
the man to whom she is already&mdash;&mdash;” Again there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
was a falter in his voice&mdash;“already really a wife, so
far as anything short of&mdash;short of the actual thing
itself&mdash;can make her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He came to a sudden stop; he was unable to finish;
he had invited us to a dispassionate consideration of
the case as a case, as a problem; in the end he was
not equal to laying it before us dispassionately. “Oh,
you see, Father!” he groaned.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sir Paget. “I see the thing&mdash;on your
hypothesis. She couldn’t make up her mind&mdash;or
wouldn’t admit that she had. So she told the other
man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Valdez?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Julius. Arsenio Valdez. She told Arsenio
to be at a certain spot at a certain time&mdash;a time
when, if she were going to keep her promise, she
would be getting ready for her wedding. ‘Be at the
corner of St. James’s Street at one o’clock.’ That
would be it, wouldn’t it? If I drive by in a taxi,
alone, it means yes to you, no to him. If I don’t,
it means the opposite.’ That’s what you mean,
Waldo?”</p>

<p>Waldo nodded assent; but I could not readily
accept the idea.</p>

<p>“You mean, when I saw her she’d just seen him,
and when I saw him, he’d just seen her?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that account for the animation and excitement
you noticed in her face&mdash;for the flush that
struck you? She had just given the signal; she’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
just”&mdash;he smiled grimly&mdash;“crossed her Rubicon,
Julius.”</p>

<p>“But why wasn’t he with her? Why didn’t he
go with her? Why did he come to the wedding?
Why did he go through that farce?”</p>

<p>Sir Paget shrugged his shoulders. “Some idea of
throwing us off the scent and getting a clear start,
probably.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it might have been that,” I admitted. “And
it does account for&mdash;for the way she looked. But
the idea never crossed my mind. There wasn’t a
single thing in his manner to raise any suspicion of
the sort. If you’re right, it was a wonderful bit of
acting.”</p>

<p>Waldo turned to me&mdash;he had been looking intently
at his father while Sir Paget expounded the
case&mdash;with a sharp movement. “Did Monkey ask
for me when he came to the church?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think he did. Yes, he did. He said he’d
like to see you and&mdash;and say something, you know.”</p>

<p>“I thought so! That would have been his moment!
He wanted to see how I took it, damn him!
Coming to the church was his idea. He may have
persuaded her that it was a good ruse, a clever
trick. But really he wanted to see me&mdash;in the dirt.
Monkey Valdez all over!”</p>

<p>I believe that I positively shivered at the bitterness
of his anger and hatred. They had been chums, pals,
bosom friends. And I loved&mdash;I had loved&mdash;them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
both. Sir Paget, too, had made almost a son of
Arsenio Valdez.</p>

<p>“And for that&mdash;he shall pay,” said Waldo, rising
to his feet. “Doesn’t he deserve to pay for that,
Father?”</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do, Waldo?”</p>

<p>“Catch him and&mdash;give him his deserts.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have left the country before you can catch
him.”</p>

<p>“I can follow him. And I shall. I can find him,
never fear!”</p>

<p>“You must think of her,” I ventured to suggest.</p>

<p>“Afterwards. As much as you like&mdash;afterwards.”</p>

<p>“But by the time you find them, they’ll have&mdash;I
mean, they’ll be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, for God’s sake, Julius!”</p>

<p>I turned to Sir Paget. “If he insists on going, let
me go with him, sir,” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, that would be&mdash;wise,” he assented, but, as
I thought, rather absently.</p>

<p>Waldo gave a laugh. “All right, Julius. If you
fancy the job, come along and pick up the pieces!
There’ll be one of us to bury, at all events.” I
suppose that I made some instinctive gesture of
protest, for he added: “She was mine&mdash;mine.”</p>

<p>Sir Paget looked from him to me, and back again
from me to him.</p>

<p>“You must neither of you leave the country,”
he said.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">A HIGH EXPLOSIVE</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">I HAVE said so much about Waldo’s “rages” that
I may have given quite a wrong impression of
him. The “rages” were abnormal, rare and
(if one may not use the word unnatural about a thing
that certainly was in his nature) at least paradoxical.
The normal&mdash;the all but invariable and the ultimately
ruling&mdash;Waldo was a placid, good-tempered fellow;
not very energetic mentally, yet very far from a
fool; a moderate Conservative, a good sportsman,
an ardent Territorial officer, and a crack rifle-shot.
He had an independent fortune from his mother,
and his “Occupation” would, I suppose, have to be
entered on the Government forms as “None” or
“Gentleman”; all the same, he led a full, active,
and not altogether useless existence. Quite a type
of his class, in fact, except for those sporadic rages,
which came, I think, in the end from an extreme, an
exaggerated, sense of justice. He would do no
wrong, but neither would he suffer any; it seemed to
him an outrage that any one should trench on his
rights: among his rights he included fair, honorable
and courteous treatment&mdash;and a very high standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of it. He asked what he gave. It seems odd that a
delicacy of sensitiveness should result, even now and
then, in a mad-bull rage, but it is not, when one
thinks it over, unintelligible.</p>

<p>Sir Paget had spoken in his most authoritative
tone; he had not proffered advice; he issued an
order. I had never known Waldo to refuse, in the
end, to obey an order from his father. Would he
obey this one? It did not look probable. His retort
was hot.</p>

<p>“I at least must judge this matter for myself.”</p>

<p>“So you shall then, when you’ve heard my reasons.
Sit down, Waldo.”</p>

<p>“I can listen to you very well as I am, thank you.”
“As he was” meant standing in the middle of the
room, glowering at Sir Paget, who was still smoking
in front of the fireplace. I was halfway between
them, facing the door of the room. “And I can’t
see what reasons there can be that I haven’t already
considered.”</p>

<p>“There can be, though,” Sir Paget retorted
calmly. “And when I tell you that I have to break
my word in giving them to you, I’m sure that you
won’t treat them lightly.”</p>

<p>Frowning formidably, Waldo gave an impatient
and scornful toss of his head. He was very hostile,
most unamenable to reason&mdash;or reasons.</p>

<p>At this moment in walked Miss Fleming&mdash;Aunt
Bertha as we all called her, though I at least had no
right to do so. She was actually aunt to Waldo’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
mother, the girl much younger than himself whom
Sir Paget had married in his fortieth year, and who
had lived for only ten years after her marriage.
When she fell sick, Aunt Bertha had come to Cragsfoot
to nurse her; she had been there ever since, mistress
of Sir Paget’s house, his <i>locum tenens</i> while he
was serving abroad, guide of Waldo’s youth, now the
closest friend in the world to father and son alike&mdash;and,
looking back, I am not sure that there was then
any one nearer to me either. I delighted in Aunt
Bertha.</p>

<p>She was looking&mdash;as indeed she always did to me&mdash;like
a preternaturally aged and wise sparrow, with
her tiny figure, her short yet aquiline nose, her eyes
sparkling and keen under the preposterous light-brown
“front” which she had the audacity to wear.
I hastened to wheel a chair forward for her, and she
sank into it (it was an immense “saddlebag” affair
and nearly swallowed her) with a sigh of weariness.</p>

<p>“How I hate big hotels, and lifts, and modern
sumptuousness in general,” she observed.</p>

<p>None of us made any comment or reply. Her
eyes twinkled quickly over the group we made, resting
longest on Waldo’s stubborn face. But she
spoke to me. “Put me up to date, Julius.”</p>

<p>That meant a long story. Well, perhaps it gave
Waldo time to cool off a little; halfway through he
even sat down, though with an angry flop.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Aunt Bertha at the end. “And you
may all imagine the morning I had! I got to Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Street at half-past eleven. Lucinda still out for a
walk&mdash;still! At twelve, no Lucinda! At half-past,
anxiety&mdash;at one, consternation&mdash;and for Mrs. Knyvett,
sherry and biscuits. At about a quarter to two,
despair. And then&mdash;the note! I never went
through such a morning! However, she’s in bed
now&mdash;with a hot-water bottle. Oh, I don’t blame
her! Paget, you’re smoking too many cigarettes!”</p>

<p>“Not, I think, for the occasion,” he replied
suavely. “Was Mrs. Knyvett&mdash;she was upset, of
course&mdash;but was she utterly surprised?”</p>

<p>“What makes you ask that, Paget?”</p>

<p>“Well, people generally show some signs of what
they’re going to do. One may miss the signs at the
time, but it’s usually possible to see them in retrospect,
to interpret them after the event.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you can, or I can, or the Knyvett
woman can?” Aunt Bertha asked rather sharply.</p>

<p>“Never mind me for the minute. Did it affect
her&mdash;this occurrence&mdash;just as you might expect?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I should say so, Paget. The poor soul
was completely knocked over, flabbergasted, shocked
out of her senses. But&mdash;well now, upon my word,
Paget! She did put one thing rather queerly.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Sir Paget. Waldo looked up with an
awakened, though still sullen, animation. I was listening
with a lively interest; somehow I felt sure
that these two wise children of the world&mdash;what
things must they not have seen between them?&mdash;would
get at something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“When her note came&mdash;that note, you know&mdash;what
would you have said in her place? No, I don’t
mean that. You’d have said: ‘Well, I’m damned!’
But what would you have expected her to say?”</p>

<p>“‘Great God!’ or perhaps ‘Good gracious!’” Sir
Paget suggested doubtfully.</p>

<p>“She’s gone&mdash;gone!” I ventured to submit.</p>

<p>“Just so&mdash;just what I should have said,” Aunt
Bertha agreed. “Something like that. What our
friend Mrs. Knyvett did say to me was, ‘Miss Fleming,
she’s done it!’”</p>

<p>“What did you say?” Sir Paget as nearly
snapped this out as a man of his urbanity could snap.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I said anything. There seemed
nothing to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you knew what she meant?”</p>

<p>Aunt Bertha pouted her lips and looked, as it
might be, apprehensively, at Sir Paget.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I must have,” she concluded&mdash;with
an obvious air of genuine surprise.</p>

<p>“We sometimes find that we have known&mdash;in a
way&mdash;things that we never realized that we knew,”
said Sir Paget&mdash;“much what I said before. But&mdash;well,
you and Mrs. Knyvett both seem to have had
somewhere in your minds the idea&mdash;the speculation&mdash;that
Lucinda might possibly do what she has done.
Can you tell us at all why? Because that sort of
thing doesn’t generally happen.”</p>

<p>“By God, no!” Waldo grunted out. “And I
don’t see much good in all this jaw about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>A slight, still pretty, flush showed itself on Aunt
Bertha’s wrinkled cheeks&mdash;hers seemed happy
wrinkles, folds that smiles had turned, not furrows
plowed by sorrow&mdash;“I’ve never been married,” she
said, “and I was only once in love. He was killed
in the Zulu war&mdash;when you were no more than a
boy, Paget. So perhaps I’m no judge. But&mdash;darling
Waldo, can you forgive me? She’s never
of late looked like&mdash;like a girl waiting for her lover.
That’s all I’ve got to go upon, Paget, absolutely all.”</p>

<p>I saw Waldo’s hands clench; he sat where he was,
but seemed to do it with an effort.</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Knyvett?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to be got out of her just now. But, of
course, if she really had the idea, it must have been
because of Arsenio Valdez!”</p>

<p>The name seemed a spur-prick to Waldo; he almost
jumped to his feet. “Oh, we sit here talking
while&mdash;&mdash;!” he mumbled. Then he raised his
voice, giving his words a clearer, a more decisive
articulation. “I’ve told you what I’m going to do.
Julius can come with me or not, as he likes.”</p>

<p>“No, Waldo, you’re not going to do it. I love&mdash;I
have loved&mdash;Lucinda. I held my arms open to
her. I thought I was to have what I have never
had, what I have envied many men for having&mdash;a
daughter. Well, now&mdash;&mdash;” his voice, which had
broken into tenderness, grew firm and indeed harsh
again. “But now&mdash;what is she now?”</p>

<p>“Monkey Valdez’s woman!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>These words, from Waldo’s lips, were to me almost
incredible. Not for their cruelty&mdash;I knew
that he could be cruel in his rage&mdash;but for their
coarse vulgarity. I did not understand how he
could use them. A second later he so far repented&mdash;so
far recovered his manners&mdash;as to say, “I beg
your pardon for that, Aunt Bertha.”</p>

<p>“My poor boy!” was all the old lady said.</p>

<p>“Whatever she may be&mdash;even if she were really
all that up to to-day you thought&mdash;you mustn’t go
after her now, Waldo&mdash;neither you nor Julius with
you.” He paused a moment, and then went on
slowly. “In my deliberate judgment, based on certain
facts which have reached me, and reënforced by
my knowledge of certain persons in high positions,
all Europe will be at war in a week, and this country
will be in it&mdash;in a war to the death.  You fellows
will be wanted; we shall all be wanted. Is that the
moment to find you two traipsing over the Continent
on the track of a runaway couple, getting
yourselves into prison, perhaps; anyhow quite uncertain
of being able to get home and do your duty as
gentlemen? And you, Waldo, are a soldier!”</p>

<p>Waldo sat down again; his eyes were set on his
father’s face.</p>

<p>“You can’t suspect me of a trick&mdash;or a subterfuge.
You know that I believe what I’m telling you, and
you know that I shouldn’t believe it without weighty
reasons?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Waldo agreed in a low tone. His passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
seemed to have left him; but his face and voice were
full of despair. “This is pretty well a matter of
life and death to me&mdash;to say nothing of honor.”</p>

<p>“Where does your honor really lie?” He threw
away his cigarette, walked across to his son, and laid
a hand on his shoulder. But he spoke first to me.
“As I told you, I am breaking my word in mentioning
this knowledge of mine. It is desirable to confine
that breach of confidence to the narrowest possible
limits. If I convince Waldo, will you, Julius,
accept his decision?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Sir Paget. Besides, why should I go
without him? Indeed, how could I&mdash;well, unless
Mrs. Knyvett&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Knyvett has nothing to do with our side of
the matter. Waldo, will you come out with me for
an hour?”</p>

<p>Waldo rose slowly. “Yes. I should like to
change first.” He still wore his frock coat and
still had a white flower in his buttonhole. Receiving
a nod of assent from Sir Paget, he left the
room. Sir Paget returned to the fireplace and lit
a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p>“He will do what’s right,” he pronounced. “And
I think we’d better get him to Cragsfoot to-morrow.
You come too, Julius. We’ll wait developments
there. I have done and said what I could in
quarters to which I have access. There’s nothing to
do now but wait for the storm.”</p>

<p>He broke away from the subject with an abrupt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
turn to Aunt Bertha. “It’s a damned queer affair.
Have you any views?”</p>

<p>“The mother’s weak and foolish, and keeps some
rather second-rate company,” said the old lady.
“Surroundings of that sort have their effect even on
a good girl. And she’s very charming&mdash;isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“You know her yourself,” Sir Paget observed
with a smile.</p>

<p>“To men, I mean. In that particular way,
Paget?”</p>

<p>“Well, Julius?”</p>

<p>“Oh, without a doubt of it. Just born to make
trouble!”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s made it! We shall meet again at
tea, Aunt Bertha? I’ll pick up Waldo at his room
along the passage. And I’d better get rid of my
wedding ornament too.” He took the rose out of
the lapel of his coat, flung it into the fireplace, and
went out of the room, leaving me with Aunt Bertha.</p>

<p>“On the face of it, she has just suddenly and very
tardily changed her mind, hadn’t the courage to face
it and own up, and so has made a bolt of it?” I
suggested.</p>

<p>“From love&mdash;sudden love, apparently&mdash;of Arsenio
Valdez, or just to avoid Waldo? For there
seems no real doubt that Arsenio’s taken her. He’s
only once been to the flat, but the girl’s been going
out for walks every day&mdash;all alone; a thing that I
understand from her mother she very seldom did
before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the Monkey all right. But that only
tells us the fact&mdash;it doesn’t explain it.”</p>

<p>“Very often there aren’t any explanations in love
affairs&mdash;no reasonable ones, Julius. Waldo takes
it very hard, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“She’s made an ass of him before all London.
It can’t really be hushed up, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Aunt Bertha admitted candidly, “if such
an affair happened in any other family, I should certainly
make it my business to find out all I could
about it.” She gave a little sigh. “It’s a shock to
me. I’ve seen a lot, and known a lot of people in my
day. But when you grow old, your world narrows.
It grows so small that a small thing can smash it.
You Rillington men had become my world; and I
had just opened it wide enough to let in Lucinda.
Now it seems that I might just as well have let in
a high explosive. In getting out again herself, she’s
blown the whole thing&mdash;the whole little thing&mdash;to
bits.”</p>

<p>“Love’s a mad and fierce master,” I said&mdash;with a
reminiscence of my classics, I think. “He doesn’t
care whom or what he breaks.”</p>

<p>“No! Poor Lucinda! I wish she’d a nice
woman with her!”</p>

<p>I laughed at that. “The nice woman would feel
singularly <i>de trop</i>, I think.”</p>

<p>“She could make her tea, and tell her that in the
circumstances she could hardly be held responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
for what she did. Those are the two ways of comforting
women, Julius.”</p>

<p>“As it is, she’s probably gone to some beastly
foreign place where there isn’t any tea fit to drink,
and Monkey Valdez is picturesquely, but not tactfully,
insisting that her wonderful way has caused
all the trouble!”</p>

<p>“Poor Lucinda!” sighed Aunt Bertha again.</p>

<p>And on that note&mdash;of commiseration, if not
actually of excuse&mdash;our conversation ended; rather
contrary to what might have been expected, perhaps,
from two people so closely allied to the deserted
and outraged lover, but because somehow Aunt
Bertha enticed me into her mood, and she&mdash;who
loved men and their company as much as any woman
whom I have known&mdash;never, I believe, thought of
them <i>en masse</i> in any other way than as the enemy-sex.
If and where they did not positively desire that
lovely women should stoop to folly, they were always
consciously or unconsciously, by the law of
their masculine being, inciting them to that lamentable
course. Who then (as the nice woman would
have asked Lucinda as she handed her the cup of
tea) were really responsible when such things came
about? This attitude of mind was much commoner
with Aunt Bertha’s contemporaries than it is to-day.
Aunt Bertha herself, however, always praised Injured
Innocence with a spice of malice. There was
just a spice of it in her pity for Lucinda and in the
remedies proposed for her consolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>My own feeling about the girl at this juncture
was much what one may have about a case of suicide.
She had ended her life as we had known her life in
recent years; that seemed at once the object and the
effect of her action. What sort of a new life lay
before her now was a matter of conjecture, and
we had slender <i>data</i> on which to base it. What did
seem permissible&mdash;in charity to her and without disloyalty
to Waldo&mdash;was some sympathy for the
struggle which she must have gone through before
her shattering resolve was reached.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FOURTH PARTY</p>

<p class="drop-cap18">AS Sir Paget had suggested, we&mdash;we three Rillington
men and Aunt Bertha&mdash;spent the
Twelve Days, the ever-famous Twelve Days
before the war, at Cragsfoot. On the public side
of that period I need say nothing&mdash;or only just one
thing. If we differed at all from the public at large
in our feelings, it was in one point only. For us,
under Sir Paget’s lead, it was less a time of hope,
fear, and suspense than of mere waiting. We other
three took his word for what was going to happen;
his certainty became ours&mdash;though, as I believe (it
is a matter of belief only, for he never told me what
he told Waldo on that walk of theirs on the afternoon
of the wedding day&mdash;which was not the day of
a wedding), his certainty was based not so much on
actual information as on a sort of instinct which
long and intimate familiarity with international affairs
had given him. But, whatever was his rock
of conviction, it never shook. Even Waldo did not
question it. He accepted it&mdash;with all its implications,
public and private.</p>

<p>Yes, and private. There his acceptance was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
only absolute; it was final and&mdash;a thing which I
found it difficult to understand&mdash;it was absolutely
silent. He never referred to his project of pursuit&mdash;and
of rescue, or revenge, or whatever else it had
been going to be. He never mentioned Lucinda’s
name; we were at pains never to pronounce it in his
presence. It was extraordinary self-control on the
part of a man whom self-control could, on occasion,
utterly forsake. So many people are not proof
against gossiping even about their own fallen idols,
though it would be generally admitted that silence is
more gracious; pedestal-makers should be sure that
they build on a sound foundation. However,
Waldo’s silence was not due to delicacy or to a
recognition of his own mistake; that, at least, was
not how I explained it. He recognized the result
of his own decision. The event that was to raise
for all the civilized world a wall of division between
past and future&mdash;whom has it not touched as human
being and as citizen?&mdash;erected a barrier between
Lucinda and himself, which no deed could pass,
which no word need describe. Only memory could
essay to wing over it a blind and baffled flight.</p>

<p>In spite of the overwhelming preoccupation of
that national crisis&mdash;Sir Paget remained in close
touch with well-informed people in town, and his
postbag gave rise to talk that lasted most of the
morning&mdash;my memory, too, was often busy with
those bygone days at Cragsfoot, when the runaways
had been of the party. Tall, slim, and fair, a girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
on the verge of womanhood, ingenuous, open, and
gay though she was, the Lucinda of those days had
something remote about her, something aloof. The
veil of virginity draped her; the shadow of it seemed
to fall over her eyes which looked at you, as it were,
from out of the depths of feelings and speculations
to which you were a stranger and she herself but
newly initiated. The world faced her with its
wonders, but the greatest, the most alluring and seductive
wonder was herself. The texture of her
skin, peculiarly rich and smooth&mdash;young Valdez
once, sitting on a patch of short close moss, had
jokingly compared it to Lucinda’s cheeks&mdash;somehow
aided this impression of her; it looked so fresh, so
untouched, as though a breath might ruffle it.
Fancy might find something of the same quality in
her voice and in her laughter, a caressing softness
of intonation, a mellow gentleness.</p>

<p>What were her origins? We were much in the
dark as to that; even Aunt Bertha, who knew everything
of that sort about everybody, here knew
nothing. The boys, Waldo and Valdez, had met
mother and daughter at a Commem’ Ball; they came
as guests of the wife of one of their dons&mdash;a lady
who enjoyed poor health and wintered in “the
South.” There, “in the South,” she had made
friends with the Knyvetts and, when they came to
England, invited them to stay. Mrs. Knyvett appeared
from her conversation (which was copious)
to be one of those widows who have just sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
means to cling to the outskirts of society at home and
abroad; she frequently told us that she could not
afford to do the things which she did do; that “a
cottage in the country somewhere” was all she
wanted for herself, but that Lucinda must “have her
chance, mustn’t she?” The late Mr. Knyvett had
been an architect; but I believe that Lucinda was by
far the greatest artistic achievement in which he
could claim any share.</p>

<p>So&mdash;quite naturally, since Waldo always invited
any friends he chose&mdash;the pair found themselves at
Cragsfoot in the summer of 1912. And the play
began. A pleasant little comedy it promised to be,
played before the indulgent eyes of the seniors,
among whom I, with only a faint twinge of regret,
was compelled to rank myself; to be in the thirties
was to be old at Cragsfoot that summer; and certain
private circumstances made one less reluctant to accept
the status of an elder.</p>

<p>Valdez paid homage in the gay, the embroidered,
the Continental fashion; Waldo’s was the English
style. Lucinda seemed pleased with both, not much
moved by either, more interested in her own power
to evoke these strange manifestations than in the
meaning of the manifestations themselves. Then
suddenly the squall came&mdash;and, as suddenly, passed;
the quarrel, the “row,” between Waldo and Valdez;
over (of all things in the world) the Legitimist
principle! The last time I had seen Waldo in a
rage&mdash;until the day that was to have brought his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
wedding with Lucinda! It had been a rage too;
and Valdez, a fellow not lacking in spirit as I had
judged him, took it with a curious meekness; he
protested indeed, and with some vigor, but with a
propitiatory air, with an obvious desire to appease
his assailant. We elders discussed this, and approved
it. Waldo was the host, he the guest; for
Aunt Bertha’s and Sir Paget’s sake he strove to end
the quarrel, to end the unpleasantness of which he
was the unfortunate, if innocent, cause. He behaved
very well indeed; that was the conclusion we
arrived at. And poor dear Waldo&mdash;oh, badly,
badly! He quite frightened poor Lucinda. Her
eyes looked bright&mdash;with alarm; her cheeks were
unwontedly, brilliantly red&mdash;with excited alarm.
The girl was all of a quiver! It was inexcusable in
Waldo; it was generous of Valdez to accept his
apologies&mdash;as we were given to understand that he
had when the two young men appeared, rather stiff
to one another but good friends, at the breakfast
table the next morning.</p>

<p>How did this view look now&mdash;in the light of
recent events? Was there any reason to associate
the old quarrel of 1912 with the catastrophe which
had now befallen Waldo? I had an impulse to put
these questions to Aunt Bertha, perhaps to Sir Paget
too. But, on reflection, I kept my thoughts to myself.
Silence was the <i>mot d’ordre</i>; Waldo himself
had set the example.</p>

<p>It was on the Saturday&mdash;the day on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
question of Belgian neutrality defined itself, according
to my uncle’s information, as the vital point&mdash;that,
wearied by a long talk about it and oppressed
by Waldo’s melancholy silence, I set out for a walk
by myself. Cragsfoot, our family home, lies by the
sea, on the north coast of Devon; a cleft in the high
cliffs just leaves room for the old gray stone house
and its modest demesne; a steep road leads up to the
main highway that runs along the top of the cliff
from east to west. I walked up briskly, not pausing
till I reached the top, and turned to look at the sea.
I stood there, taking in the scene and snuffing in the
breeze. A sudden wave of impatient protest swept
over my mind. Wars and rumors of wars&mdash;love
and its tragedies&mdash;troubles public and private! My
holiday was being completely spoilt. A very small
and selfish point of view, no doubt, but human, after
all.</p>

<p>“Oh, damn the whole thing!” I exclaimed aloud.</p>

<p>It must have been aloud&mdash;though I was not conscious
that it was&mdash;for another audible voice spoke
in response.</p>

<p>“That’s just what Father said this morning!”</p>

<p>“It’s just what everybody’s saying,” I groaned.
“But&mdash;well, how are you after all this time, Miss
Frost?”</p>

<p>For it was Nina Frost who stood beside me and I
felt oddly surprised that, in my retrospect of that
earlier summer at Cragsfoot, I had never thought
of her; because she had been a good deal with us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
our sports and excursions. But the plain fact is
that there had been little about her in those days that
would catch a mature man’s attention or dwell in
his memory. She was a chit of a girl, a couple of
years or so younger than Lucinda, much more the
school-girl, pretty enough but rather insignificant,
attaching herself to the other three rather by her
own perseverance than thanks to any urgent pressing
on their part. Lucinda had altogether outshone her
in the eyes of us all; she had been “little Nina Frost
from Briarmount.”</p>

<p>But now&mdash;she was different. A first glance
showed that. She was not only taller, with more
presence; she had acquired not merely an ease of
manner; it was a composure which was quite mature,
and might almost be called commanding.</p>

<p>“You’ve changed!” I found myself exclaiming.</p>

<p>“Girls do&mdash;between sixteen and eighteen&mdash;or
nearly nineteen! Haven’t you noticed it, Mr. Rillington?”
She smiled. “Hasn’t Lucinda changed
too? I expect so! Oh, but you’ve been abroad,
haven’t you? And since she didn’t&mdash;I mean, since
the wedding didn’t&mdash;Oh, well, anyhow, perhaps you
haven’t seen her?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t seen her.” I had not&mdash;officially.
“Are you going towards Briarmount? May I walk
with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do. And perhaps I haven’t changed so
much, after all. You see, you never took much
notice of me. Like the others, you were dazzled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
by Lucinda. Are you at liberty to tell me anything,
Mr. Rillington? If you aren’t, I won’t ask.”</p>

<p>She implied that she was not much changed. But
would any child of sixteen put it like that? I
thought it precocious for eighteen; for it cornered
me. I had to lie, or admit practically the whole
thing. I tried to fence.</p>

<p>“But didn’t you go to the wedding yourself?” I
asked. “If you did&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. Father wasn’t very well, and I
had to stay down with him.”</p>

<p>As we walked, I had been slyly studying her face:
she had grown handsome in a style that was bold
and challenging, yet in no way coarse; in fact, she
was very handsome. As she gave me her most
respectable reason for not having attended&mdash;or attempted
to attend&mdash;Waldo’s wedding, she grew just
a little red. Well, she was still only eighteen; her
education, though I remained of opinion that it had
progressed wonderfully, was not complete. She
was still liable to grow red when she told fibs. But
why was she telling a fib?</p>

<p>She recovered her composure quickly and turned
to me with a rather sharp but not unpleasant little
laugh. “As it turned out, I’m glad. It must have
been a very uncomfortable occasion.” She laughed
again&mdash;obviously at me. “Come, Mr. Rillington,
be sensible. There are servants at Cragsfoot.
And there are servants at Briarmount. Do you suppose
that I haven’t heard all the gossip through my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
maid? Of course I have! And can’t I put two and
two together?”</p>

<p>I had never&mdash;we had never&mdash;thought of this obvious
thing. We had thought that we could play
the ostrich with its head in the sand! Our faithful
retainers were too keen-sighted for that!</p>

<p>“Besides,” she pursued, “when smart society weddings
have to be put off, because the bride doesn’t
turn up at the last moment, some explanation is put
in the papers&mdash;if there is an explanation. And she
gets better or worse! She doesn’t just vanish, does
she, Mr. Rillington?”</p>

<p>I made no reply; I had not one ready.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s no business of mine. Only&mdash;I’m sorry
for Waldo, and dear Miss Fleming.” A gesture of
her neatly gloved and shapely hands seemed to dismiss
the topic with a sigh. “Have you seen anything
of Don Arsenio lately?” she asked the next
moment. “Is he in England?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He was at the wedding&mdash;well, at the
church, I mean.”</p>

<p>She came to a stop, turning her face full round to
me; her lips were parted in surprise, her white teeth
just showing; her eyes seemed full of questions. If
she had “scored off” me, at least I had startled her
that time. “Was he?” she murmured.</p>

<p>At the point to which our walk had now brought
us, the cliffs take a great bulge outwards, forming a
bold rounded bluff. Here, seeming to dominate, to
domineer over, a submissive Bristol Channel, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Jonathan Frost (as he then was&mdash;that is, I think,
the formula) had built his country seat; and “Briarmount”
he had called it.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens,” said I, “what’s happened to the
place? It’s grown! It’s grown as much as you
have!”</p>

<p>“We’ve built on a bit&mdash;a few more bedrooms, and
bathrooms. And garages, you know. Oh, and a
ballroom!”</p>

<p>“No more than that?”</p>

<p>“Not at present. Come in and have a look&mdash;and
some tea. Or are you in too deep mourning?”</p>

<p>I found myself not exactly liking the girl, but interested
in her, in her composure&mdash;and her impudence.
I accepted her invitation.</p>

<p>Since he could very well afford it, no blame need
rest on Mr. Frost for building himself a large house
and equipping it sumptuously. The only thing was
that, when he had got it, he did not seem to care a
bit about it. Probably he built it to please Nina&mdash;or
to enshrine Nina; no doubt he found in his
daughter a partial and agreeable solution of the difficulty
of how to spend the money which he could not
help making. He himself was a man of the simplest
ways and tastes&mdash;almost of no tastes at all. He
did not even drink tea; while we took ours, he consumed
a small bowlful of one of those stuffs which,
I believe, they call cereals&mdash;this is a large domed
hall of glass&mdash;conservatory, winter-garden, whatever
it should be called&mdash;full of exotic plants and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
opening on a haughty terrace with a view of the sea.
He was small, slight, shabby, simple, and rather
nervous. Still I gazed on him with some awe; he was
portentously rich; Mother Earth labored, and her
children sweated, at his bidding; he waved wands,
and wildernesses became&mdash;no, not quite paradises
perhaps, but at all events garden-cities; he moved
mountains and where the ocean had been he made
dry land. Surely it beseems us to look with some
awe on a man like that? I, at least, being more or
less in the same line of business, recognized in him a
master.</p>

<p>He greeted me very kindly, though I think that it
had cost him an effort to “place” me, to remember
who I was. He spoke warmly of the kindness
which my uncle and Miss Fleming had shown to his
motherless girl. “They’ve made you quite at home
at Cragsfoot, haven’t they, Nina? And your cousin
Waldo&mdash;Mr. Waldo taught you billiards, didn’t
he?” (There was no billiard room at Cragsfoot;
these lessons presumably took place at Briarmount.)
“And he made company for your rides, too! I hope
he’s very well, Mr. Rillington? Oh, but didn’t you
tell me that he was engaged to be married, my
dear?”</p>

<p>One must allow for preoccupation with important
affairs. Still, this was Saturday; as recently as the
preceding Tuesday week, Mr. Frost would have attended
Waldo’s wedding, but for his own indisposition.
I stole a glance at Nina; she was just a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
red again. I was not far from embarrassment myself&mdash;on
Waldo’s account; I gave a weak laugh and
said: “I’m afraid it’s not quite certain that the event
will come off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he murmured apologetically.
“It was the pretty girl who came here
with him once or twice&mdash;Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;yes, Miss
Knyvett?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was, Mr. Frost. But the&mdash;well, the arrangement
is sort of&mdash;of suspended.” With that
distinctly lame explanation I rose to take my leave.</p>

<p>I rather thought that Nina, being by now pretty
plainly convicted of fibbing, would stay where she
was, and thus avoid being left alone with me. However,
she escorted me back through Briarmount’s
spacious hall&mdash;furnished as a sitting-room and very
comfortable. She even came out into the drive with
me and, as she gave me her hand in farewell, she
said, with a little jerk of her head back towards the
scene of my talk with her father, “After that, I
suppose you’re wondering what was the real reason
for my not coming to the wedding?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am. Because you seem to have kept
up the old friendship since I’ve been away.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes people don’t go to functions because
they’re not invited.”</p>

<p>“What, you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I should have been the skeleton at the feast!”
She looked me in the face, smiling, but in a rather
set, forced fashion. Then, as she turned away, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
added with a laugh, “Only, as it turned out, there
was no feast, was there, Mr. Rillington?”</p>

<p>When I got back to Cragsfoot, I met Waldo in the
garden, walking up and down in a moody fashion
and smoking his pipe. “Been for a walk?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I started on one, but I met Nina Frost and she
took me in to tea.”</p>

<p>He stood still, smoking and staring out to sea.
“Did she say anything about me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Hardly about you yourself. She referred to&mdash;the
affair. The servants have been chattering, it
seems. Well, they would, of course!”</p>

<p>He gave a nod of assent. Then he suddenly
burst out in a vehement exclamation: “She wasn’t
there to see it, anyhow, thank God!” With that
he walked quickly away from me and was soon hidden
in the shrubbery at the end of the walk.</p>

<p>How did he know that she had not come to the
church? He had not been in the body of the church
himself&mdash;only in the vestry. Many people had
actually gone in&mdash;early arrivals; Sir Paget had told
me so. Many more had been turned away from the
doors. Waldo could not have known from his own
observation that Nina Frost was not there. Possibly
somebody had told him. More probably he
had known beforehand that she would not be there,
because she had not been invited. But why should
he thank God that she was not at the church?</p>

<p>So there was the coil&mdash;unexplained, nay, further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
complicated by the intrusion of a fourth party, Miss
Nina Frost. Unexplained I had to leave it. The
next morning&mdash;Sunday though it was&mdash;Sir Paget
carried me off to town, by motor and rail, to interview
some bigwig to whom he had mentioned me
and who commanded my attendance. I had not
even a chance of a private talk with Aunt Bertha,
whose silence about Nina now struck me as rather
odd.</p>

<p>The war was upon us. It had many results for
many people. One result of it was that, instead of
the start of hours for which they had schemed, our
runaway couple secured a start of years. That
made a great difference.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">CATCH WHO CATCH CAN!</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">I DO not want to say more about the war or my
doings during it than is strictly necessary to my
purpose. The great man to whom I have referred
took a note of my qualifications. Nothing
came of this for a good many months, during which
I obtained a commission, went through my training,
and was for three months fighting in France. Then
I was called back, and assigned to non-combatant
service (it was not always strictly that, as a nasty
scar on my forehead, the result of a midnight
“scrap” in a South American seaport where I happened
to be on business, remains to testify). My
knowledge of various parts of the world and my
command of languages made me of value for the
quasi-diplomatic, quasi-detective job with which I
was entrusted, and I continued to be employed on
it throughout the war. It entailed a great deal of
traveling by sea and land, and a lot of roughing it;
it was interesting and sometimes amusing; there was,
of course, no glory in it. I was a mole, working
underground; there were a lot of us. For the best
part of a year I was out of Europe; I was often out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of reach of letters, though now and then I got one
from Aunt Bertha, giving me such home news as
there was, and copying out extracts from what she
described as “Waldo’s miserable letters” from
France&mdash;meaning thereby not unhappy&mdash;he wrote
very cheerfully&mdash;but few, short, and scrappy. Sir
Paget, it appeared, had found some sort of advisory
job&mdash;a committee of some kind&mdash;in connection with
the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>It was when I came back to Europe, in the spring
of 1916, and was staying for a few days at a small
town in the South of France&mdash;I was at the time
covering my tracks, pending the receipt of certain
instructions for which I was waiting, but there is no
harm in saying now that the town was Ste. Maxime&mdash;that
I ran into Lucinda Knyvett. That is almost
literal. I came round a sharp corner of the street
from one direction, she from another. A collision
was so narrowly avoided that I exclaimed, “<i>Pardon!</i>”
as I came to an abrupt stop and raised my
hat. She stopped short too; the next moment she
flung out both her hands to me, crying, “You,
Julius!” Then she tried to draw her hands back,
murmuring, “Perhaps you won’t&mdash;&mdash;!” But I had
caught her hands in mine and was pressing them.
“Yes! And it’s you, Lucinda!”</p>

<p>It was about midday, and she readily accepted
my suggestion that we should lunch together. I
took her to a pleasant little restaurant on the sea-front.
It was bright, warm, calm weather; we ate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
our meal out of doors, in the sunshine. In reply
to her inquiries&mdash;made without any embarrassment,&mdash;I
told her what Cragsfoot news I had. She, in
return, told me that Arsenio&mdash;he also was mentioned
without embarrassment&mdash;had gone to Italy
when that country entered the war, and was at this
moment on the staff of some General of Division;
he wrote very seldom, she added, and, with that,
fell into silence, as she sipped a glass of wine.</p>

<p>She had changed from a girl into a woman; yet I
did not divine in her anything like the development
I had marked in Nina Frost. In appearance, air,
and manner she was the Lucinda whom I had known
at Cragsfoot; her eyes still remotely pondering,
looking inwards as well as outwards, the contour
of her face unchanged, her skin with all its soft
beauty. But she was thinner, and looked rather
tired.</p>

<p>“Arsenio told me that you saw me in the taxi
that day,” she said suddenly.</p>

<p>“He must have been very much amused, wasn’t
he? He certainly made a pretty fool of me! And
put the cap on it by coming to the&mdash;to the church,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I suppose, when once he’d met you, he was
bound to go there, or you’d have suspected.”</p>

<p>“He could have made some excuse to leave me,
and not turned up again.”</p>

<p>She did not pursue her little effort to defend Valdez;
she let it go with a curious smile, half-amused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
half-apologetic. I smiled back. “Monkey Valdez,
I think!” said I. She would not answer that, but
her smile persisted. “You were looking very happy
and bonny,” I added.</p>

<p>“I was happy that day. I had at last done right.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you had!” That was to myself. To
her I said, rather dryly, “It certainly was at the
last, Lucinda.”</p>

<p>“It was as soon as I knew&mdash;as soon as I really
knew.”</p>

<p>The waiter brought coffee. She took a cigarette
from me, and we both began to smoke.</p>

<p>“And it’s true that I didn’t dare to face Waldo.
I was physically afraid. He’d have struck me.”</p>

<p>“Never!” I exclaimed, indignant at the aspersion
on my kinsman.</p>

<p>“Oh, but yes!&mdash;I thought that he would fight Arsenio
that night at Cragsfoot&mdash;the night Arsenio
first kissed me.” She let her cigarette drop to the
ground, and leant back in her chair. Her eyes were
on mine, but the shadow of the veil was thick. “It
all began then&mdash;at least, I realized the beginning
of it. It all began then, and it never stopped till
that day when I ran away. Shall I tell you
about it?”</p>

<p>“We were all very fond of you&mdash;all of us. I
wish you would.”</p>

<p>She laid her hand on my arm for a moment. “I
couldn’t have told then&mdash;perhaps I can now. But,
dear Julius, perhaps not quite plainly. There’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
shame in it. Some, I think, for all of us&mdash;most, I
suppose, for me.”</p>

<p>At this point a vision of Aunt Bertha’s “nice
woman” flitted before my mind’s eye; it was a moment
for her ministrations&mdash;or ought to have been,
perhaps. Lucinda was rather ruminative than distressed.</p>

<p>“We were very happy that summer. I had never
had anything quite like it. Mother and I went to
lunches and teas&mdash;and I’d just begun to go to a few
dances. But people didn’t ask us to stay in country
houses. Three days’ visit to Mrs. Wiseman at
Oxford was an event&mdash;till Cragsfoot came! I love
that old house&mdash;and I shall never see it again!&mdash;Oh,
well&mdash;&mdash;! The boys were great friends; all three
of us were. If anything, Waldo and I took sides
against Arsenio, chaffing him about his little foreign
ways, and so on, you know. Waldo called
him Monkey; I called him ‘Don’&mdash;sometimes ‘Don
Arsenio.’ I called Waldo just ‘Waldo’&mdash;and I
should have called Arsenio just by his name, only
that once, when we were alone, he asked me to,
rather sentimentally&mdash;something about how his
name would sound on my lips! So I wouldn’t&mdash;to
tease him. I thought him rather ridiculous. I’ve
always thought him ridiculous at times. Well, then,
Nina Frost took to coming a good deal; Miss Fleming
had pity on her, as she told me&mdash;her mother
wasn’t long dead, you know, and she was all alone
at Briarmount with a governess. Do you remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Fräulein Borasch? No? I believe you hardly remember
Nina? You hardly ever came on excursions,
and so on, with us. The boys told me all that
sort of thing bored ‘old Julius.’ Nina rather broke
up our trio; we fell into couples&mdash;you know how
that happens? The path’s too narrow, or the boat’s
too small, or you take sides at tennis. And so on.
For the first time then the boys squabbled a little&mdash;for
me. I enjoyed that&mdash;even though I didn’t
think victory over little Nina anything to boast
about. Well, then came that day.”</p>

<p>Lucinda leant forward towards me, resting her
arms on the table between us; she was more animated
now; she spoke faster; a slight flush came
on her cheeks; I likened it to an afterglow.</p>

<p>“Nina had been there all the afternoon, but she
went home after tea. We’d been quite jolly,
though. But after dinner Waldo whispered to me
to come out into the garden. I went&mdash;it was a beautiful
evening&mdash;and we walked up and down together
for a few minutes. Waldo didn’t say anything at all,
but somehow I felt something new in him. I became
a little nervous&mdash;rather excited. We were
at the end of the walk, just where it goes into the
shrubbery. He said, ‘Lucinda!’&mdash;and then stopped.
I turned sharp round&mdash;towards the house, suddenly
somehow afraid to go into the shrubbery with him;
his voice had sounded curious. And there&mdash;he
must have come up as silently as a cat&mdash;was Arsenio,
looking so impishly triumphant! Waldo had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
turned with me; I heard him say ‘Damn!’ half
under his breath. ‘Do I intrude?’ Arsenio asked.
Waldo didn’t answer. The moon was bright; I
could see their faces. I felt my cheeks hot; Waldo
looked so fierce, Arsenio so mischievous. I felt
funnily triumphant. I laughed, cried, ‘Catch who
catch can!’ turned, and ran down the winding path
through the shrubbery. I ran quite a long way.
You know how the path twists? I looked back once,
and saw Arsenio running after me, laughing: I didn’t
see Waldo, but I could hear his footsteps. I ran
round another turn. By then Arsenio was quite
close. I was out of breath and stopped under a
big tree. I put my back against it, and faced Arsenio;
I think I put out my hands to keep him off&mdash;in
fun, you know. But he came and took hold
of my hands, and pulled me to him and kissed me
on my lips. ‘Caught!’ he said as he let me go.
Then I saw Waldo just a few yards off, watching
us. I was trembling all over. I ran away from
them, back towards the house; but I didn’t dare to
go straight in; I felt that I shouldn’t be able to
answer, if anybody spoke to me. I sat down on
the bench that stands close by the door, but is hidden
from it by the yew hedge. Presently I heard
them coming; I heard Waldo speaking angrily, but
as they got nearer the house, he stopped talking, so
I didn’t hear anything that he said. But Arsenio
told me&mdash;later on&mdash;that he said that English gentlemen
didn’t do things like that, though dirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Spaniards might&mdash;and so on. I sat where I was,
and let them go in. But presently I felt that I
must see what was happening. So I went in, and
found them quarreling: at least, Waldo was abusing
Arsenio&mdash;but you know about that; you were
there. I thought they’d fight&mdash;they would have if
you and Sir Paget hadn’t been there&mdash;but somehow,
by now, I didn’t mind if they did. I wasn’t
frightened any more; I was excited. You know how
it ended. I didn’t then, because after a good deal of
it Sir Paget sent me to bed&mdash;don’t you remember?
I went to bed, but I didn’t go to sleep for ever so
long. I felt that something great had happened
to me. Men had tried to kiss me a few times before;
one or two had managed just to kiss my cheek
in a laughing kind of way. This was different to
me. And there was Waldo too! I was very young.
I suddenly seemed to myself immensely important.
I wondered&mdash;oh, how I wondered&mdash;what they
would do the next morning&mdash;and what I should do.
I imagined conversations&mdash;how I should be very
stiff and dignified&mdash;and Arsenio very penitent, but
protesting his devotion. But I couldn’t imagine how
Waldo would behave. Anyhow, I felt that the
next morning would be the most awfully exciting
moment in my life, that anything might happen.”</p>

<p>Lucinda paused, looking at me with a smile that
mocked the girl whose feelings she had been describing.
“Nothing did!”</p>

<p>After another pause she went on: “Later on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of course, I heard how that was. I’ve heard it from
both of them! Arsenio didn’t really care for me at
that time, though Waldo did. And Arsenio was
very fond of Waldo; he felt he’d behaved rather
badly, and he didn’t bear malice against Waldo for
abusing him. Arsenio is malicious in a way; it’s
fun to him to make people look and feel silly; but
he doesn’t harbor malice. He’s not rancorous. He
went to Waldo’s room early in the morning&mdash;while
Waldo was still in bed&mdash;and apologized. He said
he must have had a glass too much of champagne,
that he hadn’t meant anything, and that if he’d
had the least notion how Waldo would feel about
it&mdash;and so on! In fact, he made light of the whole
thing, so far as I was concerned. Waldo listened
to it all in silence, and at the end just said, ‘All
right, old chap. There’s an end of it.’ But he
didn’t really forgive Arsenio&mdash;and he didn’t forgive
me, though it hadn’t been my fault&mdash;had it?
In the first-place, between us we’d made him give
himself away; he’s very proud, and he hates that.
In the second, he’s much better than you’d suppose
at seeing into things; he has a sort of instinct; and
from that day, right on, he was instinctively afraid
of Arsenio; he felt that, if Arsenio chose, he could
be dangerous&mdash;about me. I know it, from the way
he used to speak of him later on&mdash;when we were
engaged&mdash;always trying to probe me, to find out
my feelings about Arsenio, whether I was thinking
about him, whether I ever heard from him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
things like that. All the time he never had Arsenio
out of his mind. Well&mdash;he was right.</p>

<p>“But I knew nothing of all that at the time. To
me they seemed just a little sulky to one another,
and to me, too. Otherwise they ignored what had
happened, made nothing of it, never referred to it
in any way. I was most frightfully hurt and&mdash;and
let down. To me it had been a great beginning&mdash;of
something, though I didn’t know of what. I
couldn’t understand how Arsenio could treat it as
nothing&mdash;that he shouldn’t apologize and abase
himself if he’d meant nothing serious, that he
shouldn’t speak to me again if he really cared for
me. I felt utterly bewildered. Only I had a strange
feeling that somehow, in some way, Arsenio had
acquired a right over me by kissing my lips. Of
that feeling I never got rid.”</p>

<p>From a frown she broke into a smile again, as
she went on. “It was a miserable week&mdash;till we
went. Both the boys avoided me whenever they
could. Both have told me why since, but I don’t
believe that either of them told me the truth. Arsenio
said it was because he couldn’t trust himself
not to make love to me, and he had practically
promised that he wouldn’t. I think it was because
he thought I would expect to be made love to (I
did!), and he didn’t want to; he wasn’t in love with
me then; besides he was afraid of Waldo. Waldo
said it was because he was ashamed of himself. I
daresay he was ashamed, but it was much more because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
he was in love with me, but was too proud
to seem to compete with Arsenio. Whatever the
reasons, the result was&mdash;triumph for Nina! She
was invited over every day and all day. Both of
them tried to keep with her&mdash;in order to avoid me.
I wasn’t exactly jealous, because I knew that they
really wanted to be with me&mdash;but for the complications.
But I was exasperated to see that she
thought&mdash;as, of course, she must&mdash;that she had cut
me out. How her manner changed! Before this
she had adored me&mdash;as younger girls do older ones
sometimes; ‘Darling Lucinda!’ and so on! I’d noticed
her trying to imitate me, and she used to ask
where I got such pretty frocks. Now she patronized
me, told me how I must wish I had a nice
home (she knew I hadn’t) like Cragsfoot or Briarmount,
and said what a pity it was my mother
couldn’t give me more chances of riding, so that I
could improve! She did ride much better than I&mdash;which
made it worse.”</p>

<p>Here I looked at Lucinda, asking leave to laugh.
She gave it in her own low-murmuring laughter at
herself. “So it ended. We went away, and I was
very glad when we did. I went away without either
Arsenio or Waldo having said to me a single word
that mattered.”</p>

<p>“I must have been very dull to have noticed nothing&mdash;except
just the quarrel; well, the quarrel itself,
and how you looked while it was going on&mdash;till you
were sent to bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did I look?”</p>

<p>“Just as you did when I saw you in the taxi
at the corner by Marlborough House.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad I didn’t see you! You’d have
brought back what I’d managed to put out of my
mind. As though I could put it out of my life!”</p>

<p>Suddenly and abruptly she pushed her chair back
from the table. “Aren’t we staying here a frightfully
long time? That waiter’s staring at us.”</p>

<p>“But surely I haven’t heard all the story yet?”</p>

<p>“All the story? No. Only the prologue. And
the prologue’s a comedy, isn’t it? A children’s
comedy! The rest isn’t quite like that. Pay the
bill and let’s go. For a walk, if you like&mdash;and have
time.”</p>

<p>“I ought just to call at my hotel&mdash;the <i>Méditerranée</i>&mdash;and
see if there’s anything for me&mdash;any telegrams.
If there aren’t, I should like to sit by the
sea, and smoke, and hear the next chapter.”</p>

<p>At the moment Lucinda merely nodded. But
as we walked away, she put her arm in mine and
said, “The next chapter is called ‘Venice,’ and it’s
rather a difficult one for me to tell.”</p>

<p>“I hope I’m not a person who has to have all the
t’s crossed and all the i’s dotted. Arsenio has&mdash;or
had&mdash;a ‘palazzo’ at Venice?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We stayed there.”</p>

<p class="pch">VENICE</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE instructions for which I was waiting did
not reach me for three days: I found reason
to suspect, later on, that bribery had
been at work; they had almost certainly been delayed,
copied, and communicated to enemy quarters.
The bulk of these enforcedly idle hours I spent
with Lucinda&mdash;at the restaurant, on the sea-front,
once or twice at my hotel, but never in the little
house where she had a room: I often escorted her
to the door, but she never asked me in. But we
grew intimate; she told, I think, all, or almost all,
the story, though often still with the air of examining
herself, or of rendering an account to herself,
rather than of being anxious to tell me: sometimes
she would seem even to forget my presence. At
other points, however, she would appeal directly to
me, even urgently, as though she hung on my verdict.
These changes gave variety and life to her
story; one saw her living again through all her
moods and experiences: on the other hand, it cannot
be denied that they lengthened the narrative.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1913&mdash;the spring after their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
visit to Cragsfoot&mdash;her mother and Lucinda went to
stay on the top floor but one in Arsenio Valdez’s
palazzo at Venice, Valdez himself inhabiting the
attics immediately above them. Poverty, the satirist
remarked long ago, has no harsher incident
than that of making people ridiculous; it may have
worse moral effects. Mrs. Knyvett had not so
much accepted Valdez’s invitation as intrigued and
cadged for it; and they stayed rent free, though even
then Valdez was by no means a well-to-do man.
And Mrs. Knyvett could not receive favors in the
grand manner. She took, but she took cringingly;
she over-acknowledged, constantly by manner and
even by word, reminding the donor and herself of
the gift, reminding her daughter also. She did not,
it is true, know about the kiss in the garden at Cragsfoot;
Lucinda kept that to herself; her view was
that in her mother’s hands it would have been another
lever. “Arsenio lodged us free as it was; if
mother had known that, she’d have made him board
us too!” Even as it was, he seemed to have entertained
them a good deal (as was only natural)
while he played <i>cicerone</i>, showing them the sights
and pleasures of the place.</p>

<p>It was by no means Mrs. Knyvett’s intention or
desire that her daughter should marry Arsenio.
Her ambition flew higher. Cragsfoot was to her
still the most eligible prospect or project which had
so far presented itself; she kept in touch with it by
letters to Aunt Bertha; in them she angled for another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
invitation there, just as she had cadged for
Arsenio’s invitation to the palazzo. How many
invitations does a charming daughter “make” in
the arithmetic of genteel poverty? Arsenio was
quite aware of her attitude towards him, but it
pleased his monkeyish humor to pretend to believe
that she favored a suit which he had himself no
intention of pressing. Arsenio could not afford to
marry a poor girl, and probably did not want to
marry at all. His taste was for a bachelor life,
and his affairs were in a precarious state. He could
hardly be said to live by gambling; he existed in
spite of it&mdash;in a seesaw between prosperity and
penury; as such men do, he splashed his <i>lire</i> about
when he had them; when he was “cleaned out,” he
would disappear from the ken of the Knyvetts for
a day or two, engaged in “milking” sundry old and
aristocratic friends of his father, who still resided
at Venice in a stately and gloomy seclusion, and
could be persuaded to open their not very fat purses
to help a gentleman of Spain who upheld the Legitimist
principle, as we know&mdash;from past events&mdash;that
Arsenio did! No, he certainly did not intend at the
beginning of their visit to mate poverty to poverty.</p>

<p>But&mdash;there was Lucinda! Lucinda under blue
skies by day and soft moonlight by night. There
was that secret memory between them, the meeting
of their lips; for him an incentive to gallantry, almost
an obligation, according to his code; for her,
more subtly, a tie, a union that she could not lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nor wholly disown. He did not speak of it directly,
but he would circle round it in talk, and smile in
an impish exchange of the unspoken memory; he
would laugh at Waldo, while with feigned sincerity
he praised his sterling qualities. “Oh, his reliability,
his English steadiness&mdash;dear, good, old Waldo!
You’d trust him&mdash;even in a gondola, Lucinda!”</p>

<p>The gondola! Let it stand for the whole of
Venice’s romantic paraphernalia; an old theme, a
picture painted a thousand times. No need to expatiate
on it here. To him it was all very familiar&mdash;the
nearest thing he had to a home; to her, of
course, it was a revelation. They were both susceptible
to impressions, to beauty. He retained his
sensibility, she developed hers. She saw new things
through his eyes; he saw old ones newly reflected in
the light of hers. His feelings regained freshness,
while hers grew to maturity&mdash;a warm ripeness in
which the man and the place were fused together
in one glowing whole. “Oh, I lived then!” she
cried, clasping her hands together and beating them
upon her knee.</p>

<p>Yet it must still have been with her own aloofness,
delicacy, difficulty of approach; the fires
gleamed through the veil, but the veil was round
them. He complained, it appeared, of her coldness,
of the distance at which she kept him, at relapses
into formality after hours of unreserved merriment.
Mrs. Knyvett chid her; was he not the
friend, the host, the benefactor? Within prudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
bounds he should be handsomely encouraged&mdash;and
rewarded. “Mother told me that well-bred girls
knew how to make themselves respected without
being prudish.” Maternal philosophy of an affectionately
utilitarian order&mdash;one eye on present
amenities, the other on grander prospects in the
future!</p>

<p>But was there no fear also in that maternal
breast? Did the situation and the actors raise no
apprehension? To some people&mdash;to how many?
Some have maintained to all!&mdash;morality is not a
master, but a good and ever vigilant servant. It
preserves the things that are of real value, the
marketable stuff. And it dignifies its watch and
ward with such high names, such sacred and binding
traditions, that&mdash;well, really, what between the
august sanctions on the one hand and the enormous
material advantages on the other, can it be dreamt
of that any reasonable girl will forget herself? So
one may suppose that Mrs. Knyvett reasoned. For
what, after all, is the “leading article” in a girl’s
stock-in-trade? Who, properly instructed, would
sell that under market price, and so stand bankrupt?</p>

<p>So much may be said in apology for Mrs. Knyvett’s
blindness to her daughter’s peril; for in peril
she was. Then an apology is needed for Arsenio?
It would show a lack of humor to tender it; it is
the last thing which those who have known and
liked Monkey Valdez would think of doing. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was a “good Catholic” by tradition, and a gentleman
by breeding; but he was an honest man only
by fits and starts&mdash;when honesty appealed to his
histrionic sense, when it afforded him the chance of
a <i>beau geste</i>, when he felt himself under the eyes of
the men with whom he had been brought up, who
expect honesty even in dealings with women&mdash;at all
events, with girls of their own caste; who draw a
broad distinction between an intrigue and a seduction;
who are, in fact (not to labor the subject),
born and trained adepts in the niceties, some of
them curious, of the code of honor, which is certainly
not a religious rule or an ethical system, but
may be considered to embody the laws of sex warfare,
to be a Hague Convention between the sexes.</p>

<p>Yet there is no need to picture the poor Monkey
as the deliberate villain of the stage. Your true
villain must be deliberate and must rejoice in his
villainy, or all the salt is out of him. Arsenio was
certainly not deliberate, and in no way realized
himself as a villain. The event&mdash;the course of affairs
afterwards&mdash;proves that. He probably let
his boat drift pleasantly, delightfully, down the
river, till the swirl of rapids caught it; it is likely
that he was himself surprised; the under-nature
stormed the hesitating consciousness.</p>

<p>She gave me no particulars; I asked for none.
She shrank from them, as I did. It was after a delightful
evening alone together, on the water, that
it came. Mrs. Knyvett had gone to bed; they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
alone, full of the attraction of each other&mdash;and of
“it all.” So Lucinda summed up the notoriously
amatory influences of the Adriatic’s Queen. She
appealed to me&mdash;woman now, to a man of middle
age&mdash;to understand how it happened. As she told
me&mdash;well, she hardly told me, she let me see&mdash;she
laid her hand in mine, her eyes sought mine,
straight, in question&mdash;yet hardly to me&mdash;rather to
some tribunal which she blindly sought, to which
she made a puzzled but not despairing, not altogether
too tragic, appeal: “At Cragsfoot he had
kissed my lips, you know; and I wasn’t angry. That
meant I liked him, didn’t it? That meant&mdash;&mdash;?
That meant&mdash;the same?”</p>

<p>That seemed to me to record&mdash;as she, saying it,
still seemed to retain&mdash;a wonderful freedom from
the flesh. She judged things by the spirit. A terribly
dangerous criterion; anybody can distort it;
anybody may snigger at it&mdash;though I think that it
offers more resistance to an honest laugh. There
is a sort of pathos about it. Meant the same! Poor
dear! The gulf between the two things! Immeasurable!
Let speak religion (though there perhaps
the voices have varied), morality, prudence, the rest
of them! And virgin modesty? Shall we lay its
fall most essentially in the less or the greater&mdash;in
the parley or in the surrender? That’s what she
seemed to ask. But what answer could a plain man
of the world give her?</p>

<p>She had a few&mdash;a very few days of happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of forgetfulness of everything except their love.
Then the clouds gathered. She waited for a word
from him that did not come&mdash;not the first time that
he had kept her thus waiting&mdash;yet how different!
Arsenio grew fretful, disconsolate, and sometimes
sullen. One of his disappearances occurred; he was
raising the wind among his long-suffering aristocrats;
he was scraping together every coin he could and
throwing them all on the gaming table. If fortune
smiled, he would do the right thing, and do it handsomely;
if she frowned&mdash;and there could be no
doubt that she was frowning now&mdash;what lay before
him, before them? A scamped and mean <i>ménage à
trois</i>, existence eked out with the aid of Mrs. Knyvett’s
scanty resources, and soured by her laments!
No money for gayety, for play, to cut a figure with!
He shrank from the prospect. He could not trust
his love with it; probably he did not trust hers
either. He began to draw away from her; she would
not reproach or beseech. “I had taken the chances;
I had gambled too,” she said.</p>

<p>Unless something had happened which put Arsenio
under an even more imperative obligation&mdash;one
which, as I would fain believe, he must have honored&mdash;it
seems probable that the affair would in
any case have ended as it did; but the actual manner
of its ending was shaped by an external incident.</p>

<p>The two were sitting together one morning in the
Knyvett <i>salon</i>, Lucinda mending her gloves, Arsenio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
doing nothing and saying nothing, melancholy
and fagged after a bout of gambling the night before.
Mrs. Knyvett came in, with an air of triumph,
holding a letter in her hand. She was still
ignorant of the situation; still sure that her daughter
was making herself respected&mdash;though surely less
apprehensive of her prudishness? And, while they
had been pursuing their devices, she had had hers
also to pursue. Success had crowned her efforts.
The letter was from “dearest Miss Fleming”; it invited
mother and daughter to pay another visit to
herself and Sir Paget as soon as they returned to
England; that is, in about six weeks; for they had
a stay with friends in Paris arranged in the immediate
future&mdash;a thing that had already begun to
trouble Lucinda.</p>

<p>“It’s delightful!” said Mrs. Knyvett. “Won’t it
help us splendidly through the summer! Any chance
of your being there too, Don Arsenio? That would
make it perfect!”</p>

<p>The good lady did not stay for an answer. She
had her hat on, and was going out to do her marketing.
She laid the letter down on the table between
them, and bustled out, her face still radiant
with the joy of successful maneuver.</p>

<p>So Cragsfoot, completely forgotten of recent
days, made its reëntry on the scene.</p>

<p>For a few moments they sat silent still, with the
letter between them. Then Lucinda said, “What
are we to do, Arsenio?” She raised her eyes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
her sewing and looked across at him. He did not
return her glance; he was scowling. The invitation
to Cragsfoot (he did not know about the French
visit, which Mrs. Knyvett could readily have put
off if she had preferred to stay on at Venice)
brought him up short; it presented him with an issue.
It forced Lucinda’s hand also. No mere excuse,
no mere plea of disinclination, would prevent Mrs.
Knyvett from going to Cragsfoot and taking her
daughter with her. To stay there was not only a
saving and a luxury, in her eyes it was also prestige&mdash;and
a great possibility!</p>

<p>“Damn Cragsfoot!” she heard him mutter. And
then he laid his head between his hands on the
table and began positively to sob. How much for
unsuccessful gambling, how much for too successful
love, Heaven knows! But Monkey Valdez sobbed.</p>

<p>She put down her work, went round to the back
of his chair, and put her arms about his neck. “I
know, I know, Arsenio. Don’t be so miserable,
dear. I understand. And&mdash;and there’s no harm
done. You only loved me too much&mdash;and if you
can’t do what&mdash;what I know you want to do&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He raised his head and said (in what she called
“a dead voice”), “I’m what he called me, that’s
the truth. He called me a dirty Spaniard; he said
no English gentleman would do what I did. The
night I kissed you at Cragsfoot! Waldo!”</p>

<p>“He said that to you? He told you that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Waldo? Oh, I knew he was very angry; but you’ve
never told me that he said that.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Lucinda, as she told her story to
me, “I did something, or said something, that seemed
to make him suddenly angry. What he repeated&mdash;what
Waldo had said&mdash;somehow struck me with
a queer sense of puzzle. It seemed to put him and
Waldo back into the same sort of conflict&mdash;or, at
least, contrast&mdash;that I had seen them in at Cragsfoot.
I didn’t, of course, accept the ‘dirty Spaniard’
part; Waldo was just angry when he said that. But
the words did bring Waldo back to my mind&mdash;over
against Arsenio, so to speak. I don’t know whether
you’ve ever noticed that I sometimes fall into what
they call a brown study? I get thinking things over,
and rather forget that I’m talking to people. I
wasn’t angry with Arsenio; I was feeling sorry for
him; I loved him and wanted to comfort him. But
I had to think over what he had told me&mdash;not only
(perhaps not so much) as it bore on Arsenio, but as
it bore on myself&mdash;on what I had done and felt, and&mdash;and
allowed, you know. Well, Arsenio suddenly
called out, quite angrily, ‘You needn’t pull your arms
away like that!’ I had done it, but I hadn’t been
conscious of doing it; I didn’t think about it even
then. I was thinking of him&mdash;and Waldo. And I
know that I was smiling, as the old Cragsfoot days
came back to me. I wasn’t thinking in the least
about where my arms were! ‘Of course you and
Waldo are curiously different,’ I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“He jumped to his feet as if I had struck him,
and broke out in a torrent of accusation against
me. A few minutes before he had himself said
that Waldo had told the truth about him. Now
he declared that it was I who had said it. I hadn’t
said anything of the sort&mdash;at all events, meant anything
of the sort. I suppose I was sore in my heart,
but I should never have said a word. But he would
have it that I had meant it. He talked very fast,
he never stopped. And&mdash;I must tell you the truth,
Julius&mdash;it all seemed rather ridiculous to me, rather
childish. I believe that I listened to most of it smiling&mdash;oh,
not a merry smile, but a smile all the same.
I was waiting for him to work himself out, to run
down; it was no good trying to interrupt. And all
the time the contrast was in my mind&mdash;between him
and Waldo, between Waldo’s anger and&mdash;this! I
felt as I suppose a woman feels towards her naughty
child; I wanted to scold and to kiss him both at
once. I even thought of that wicked nickname that
Waldo has for him! At last&mdash;after a great deal
of it&mdash;he dashed one hand through his hair, thumped
the table with the other, and flung out at me, ‘Then
go to him! Go to your English gentleman! Leave
me in the gutter, where I belong!’ And he rushed
out of the room. I heard his steps pattering up
the stone stairs to his own floor.”</p>

<p>“You must have been terribly distressed,” I said&mdash;or
something formal of that kind.</p>

<p>“No. I didn’t believe that anything had really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
happened. I waited half an hour to let him cool
down. But Mother might be back every minute;
there was still that question about Cragsfoot! I
had to have some answer! I went up to his apartment
and knocked. I got no answer. I went down
to Amedeo the <i>portière</i>, and he told me that Arsenio
had gone out ten minutes before&mdash;I hadn’t
heard his footsteps coming down again, he must
have stolen down softly; he was carrying a bag,
had a gondola called, and went off in the direction
of the station, saying that he would be back in a
few days. That was the end of&mdash;Venice!”</p>

<p>She came to a stop, gently strumming her fingers
on the arm of her chair. On an impulse I leant
forward and asked her a question: “Are you Madame
Valdez now, Lucinda?”</p>

<p>“Donna Lucinda Valdez, at your service, sir!
Since the day after you saw me in the taxi.”</p>

<p>“Then he must have explained&mdash;Venice?”</p>

<p>“Never. From the first day that we met again,
we have never mentioned Venice.” She touched my
arm for a moment. “I rather like that. It seems
to me rather a tactful apology, Julius. He began
courting me all afresh when he came to England.
At least he took it up from where it had stopped at
Cragsfoot.”</p>

<p>“It may be tactful; it’s also rather convenient,”
I commented gruffly. “It avoids explanations.”</p>

<p>A gleam of amusement lit up her eyes. “Poor
Arsenio! He was in a difficulty&mdash;in a corner. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
he’d been losing, his nerves were terribly wrong.
There was the question of&mdash;me! And the question
of Cragsfoot! And then Waldo came into
it&mdash;oh, I’m sure of that. Those two men&mdash;it’s
very odd. They seem fated to&mdash;to cross one another&mdash;to
affect one another sometimes. I wonder
whether&mdash;&mdash;!” She broke off, knitting her brow.
“He sounded most genuine in that outbreak of his
when he mentioned Waldo. I think he was somehow
realizing what Waldo would think and say, if
he knew about Venice. Perhaps so, perhaps not!
As for the rest of it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You think he wasn’t quite as angry as he pretended
to be?”</p>

<p>She seemed to reflect for a moment. “I didn’t
say his anger was unreal, did I? I said it was childish.
When a child runs heedlessly into something
and hurts himself, he kicks the thing and tells his
mother that it’s horrid. I was the thing, you see.
Arsenio’s half a child.” Again she paused. “He’s
also an actor. And he contrived, on the whole, a
pretty effective exit!”</p>

<p>“That you ever let him come back again is the
wonder!” I cried.</p>

<p>“No. It’s what happened before he came back
that puzzles me,” she said.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">SELF-DEFENSE</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">LUCINDA told me nothing about how “the
end of Venice” struck or affected Mrs. Knyvett.
Some bewilderment of that good lady
may be conjectured; whether she wisely asked no
questions or, asking them, received the sort of replies
which the proverb indicates as the fate of questioners,
I did not know. Nor, indeed, did I care&mdash;any
more than I cared what had become of Mrs.
Knyvett at that moment. (In fact, as I learned
afterwards, she had quartered herself&mdash;it was her
one talent!&mdash;on an old and wealthy spinster, and
was living with her at Torquay.) My interest was
where Lucinda’s was&mdash;centered in Lucinda herself.</p>

<p>Her narrative jumped straight from Venice to
Cragsfoot. She did not say anything of her feelings
in the interval; she went on to what “puzzled”
her&mdash;to the relations that came about between her
and Waldo Rillington. To those, from the beginning
and all through, Valdez and what he had
been to her formed a background, and more than
that, they were a factor and a contributory, just
as Nina Frost was. But it was in that way she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
treated them. Waldo was now the leading figure;
round him centered the main theme, the thing to
be explained.</p>

<p>“We arrived in the afternoon before tea. Only
Aunt Bertha (I noticed that she still used the name
which she had learnt to use during her engagement
to Waldo) was in; Sir Paget was in town, Waldo
was out riding. She was wonderfully nice to me.
‘My dear, you’re in great looks!’ she said. I like
those rather old-fashioned phrases of hers. ‘You
were a very pretty girl last summer, now you’re a
beautiful young woman. And you’re so grown up.
Let’s see&mdash;you’re only two years older than Nina
Frost. But she’s a school-girl&mdash;quite raw&mdash;compared
to you. She said this as if she were pleased.
I didn’t understand then why she should be, but I
came to, later. You see, Aunt Bertha never liked
Nina, and positively hated Briarmount and all its
works. We might be shabby, but to her we were
gentle folks&mdash;and the Briarmount people weren’t;
and she thought Nina bold and inclined to be impudent&mdash;in
which she was right. Don’t laugh, Julius;
if you differ, you can state your views afterwards;
you mustn’t interrupt.</p>

<p>“Mother was purring over all this&mdash;rather taking
credit for it, you know, and I was feeling, as you
may suppose, rather guilty&mdash;a feeling of false pretenses!&mdash;and
we had settled down to tea, when
I heard laughing and talking in the hall. The
door opened, and Nina appeared, ushered in by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Waldo. They had been riding; she had a good
color and was looking prettier, I thought, but her
figure was still lumpy and rather awkward. She
hesitated by the door for just a moment, giving
me a surprised look. ‘Oh, I forgot to tell you that
Mrs. Knyvett and Lucinda were due to-day,’ said
Waldo with a laugh. ‘I only knew it myself yesterday
morning.’</p>

<p>“‘I ran no risk of disappointing him,’ Aunt Bertha
explained. ‘I didn’t tell him when you were
coming till I was quite sure of the date.’</p>

<p>“I thought Waldo gave her a rather amused
glance as he passed her, greeted Mother, and then
came to me. He sat down by me, after we had
shaken hands. Nina took her tea off to the sofa;
he didn’t seem to treat her with much ceremony&mdash;perhaps
to him too she was still a school-girl; I
was grown up&mdash;and, of course, a new arrival. We
got talking and, as far as I’m concerned, I forgot
her, till I heard her saying, ‘I must go home. You’ll
ride with me, won’t you, Waldo?’ For just a moment
he didn’t answer or turn away from me. ‘You
said you would, when you persuaded me to come
in to tea,’ she added.</p>

<p>“‘Perhaps he’s tired. We’ll send a groom with
you,’ said Aunt Bertha.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, no, I’ll come, Nina. I said I would.’ He
was quite good-natured about it, but I must admit
that his voice sounded a little reluctant. He got
up and stretched himself lazily. ‘All right, I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
coming, Nina.’ She turned on her heel and marched
out, not waiting for him to open the door. He
followed, with a little shrug. When they were gone
I saw Aunt Bertha smiling to herself.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you that in detail because it&mdash;what
shall I say?&mdash;sets the scene. I can only tell you generally
how things developed. At first I was very
happy, and so, I suppose, very gay and cheerful.
I seemed, in the end, to have had a great escape
and to have got into a safe harbor. My feeling of
guiltiness wore off under their kindness. I could
see that Waldo liked and admired me&mdash;and I’ve
never been indifferent to admiration or unaffected
by it. Aunt Bertha petted me, and Sir Paget made
much of me too, when he came back. Mother, of
course, was all smiles&mdash;and enthusiastic about the
food! Then, after two or three days, Waldo told
me that he had an appointment to ride with Nina,
and asked me to come too. I laughed and said I
wouldn’t spoil their <i>tête-à-tête</i>. He looked put out,
but didn’t press me. The same thing happened
again, and he insisted on my coming; otherwise he
wouldn’t go himself. So we three began to ride,
or to walk, together. And Nina Frost began to
fight me!</p>

<p>“She had every right and every excuse. That
girl, even then, young as she was, had not only
made a hero of Waldo&mdash;that would have been a
thing that one often sees&mdash;but she adored him in
a jealous, fierce way that I&mdash;well, it’s not mine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
I hardly understand it. But I could see it in her;
she seemed to take little pains to hide it from me,
though she did try to hide it from Aunt Bertha.
And Waldo&mdash;I don’t know to this day how much
reason he had given her for hoping, but it was evident
that they had seen a great deal of one another
since my first visit, and that her homage wasn’t disagreeable
to him. You must remember that I probably
don’t do justice to her attractions! Well, she
made me angry. She assumed from the first that
I meant to catch Waldo; I was a female fortune-hunter!
She rubbed in our poverty in her old way.
And she threw out hints about Arsenio&mdash;quite at
random, but I’m not sure I always managed to look
unembarrassed. Waldo would frown at her then,
and try to shut her up; but I caught him looking
oddly at me once or twice. I had my secret to
keep; I took the obvious way of doing it; I began
to flirt with Waldo myself. That was my line of
defense, Julius. I’ve not spared my morals in what
I’ve told you, and I’m not pretending to you that I
behaved particularly nicely at Cragsfoot. I had no
business to flirt with Waldo, you’ll say, not even
in self-defense? So be it. But since I make these
concessions&mdash;<i>en revanche</i> I won’t spare my modesty
either; I had more success than I desired, or at all
events deserved. Waldo took fire!”</p>

<p>She had distinctly recollected me for a moment;
she had pronounced my name! Now she gave me
one of her smiles&mdash;never too numerous. “I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
know how much you trust me, Julius, but I really
am trying to tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“A difficult and thankless task, Lucinda?”</p>

<p>“Not thankless&mdash;somehow&mdash;to you.” She gave
me, this time, a friendly little nod, and went back
to her story. We had dined together on this evening;
I smoked my cigar and listened; everybody
else had finished, and departed; properly speaking,
the <i>salle-à-manger</i> was shut. I had tipped the
waiter to leave us one light. It shone behind her
face, throwing it into relief; the rest of the room
was in dimness. I had no difficulty at all in understanding
that her “line of defense” had proved successful&mdash;only
too sure and only too successful.</p>

<p>“When I said just now that I didn’t desire success&mdash;at
any rate beyond what was necessary to
my self-defense&mdash;I spoke too broadly. I feared too
much success; if Waldo came to love me, to ask
me to marry him, I should have to deal with a situation
the thought of which frightened me. But what
a lot of things there were to make me desire that
success! Some obvious and, if you like, vulgar&mdash;the
name, the money, the comfort, the end of cadging
and scamping. A little higher comes the appeal
that dear old Cragsfoot made to me&mdash;I should love
to live at Cragsfoot. Then I was very fond of all
you Rillingtons; it would be in its way wonderful to
belong to the family, to be one of you. And Sir
Paget and Aunt Bertha wanted me&mdash;by this time I
was quite sure of that. Especially Aunt Bertha&mdash;though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
at first, perhaps, mainly because I wasn’t
Nina Frost! Indeed, I came to believe that my
being at Cragsfoot at all just then was a plot of
Aunt Bertha’s; she had scented the Nina danger
and looked round for a weapon against it! All
those things influenced me&mdash;I suppose, too, poor
Mother’s obvious delight at the idea. But the chief
things I’ve left to the last. One I can tell you quite
simply&mdash;Nina Frost! Is that vulgar too? I daresay,
but I think it’s human. She had declared herself
my enemy. Who likes to see his enemy triumph?
And she would think that I was beaten on
my merits! If Waldo asked me, and I refused him,
could I tell her that? Would she believe me if I
did? Besides, my real triumph would be in taking
and keeping, not in refusing. If I refused, she
would step in&mdash;or so I thought. The other thing&mdash;the
last thing&mdash;was, of course, what I felt about
Waldo himself, and the way in which I should stand
towards him. It was funny. I had had no sense
of taking a chance at Venice&mdash;though I did take
a chance&mdash;gambled and, as it had turned out, lost
heavily; but there was nothing but just plain being
in love in the case at Venice. Don’t smile&mdash;love
of that kind is really very simple. But with Waldo&mdash;and
in the circumstances&mdash;matters were very different.
I liked him very much; he was such a change
from Arsenio, about whom I was still, of course,
very sore&mdash;sore, not angry. He was very jolly at
that time; if he’d behaved rather badly to Nina, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
troubled him, I think, almost as little as it troubled
me&mdash;which was not at all! But, first and foremost,
Waldo was an adventure. Great as my charms were&mdash;we’ve
agreed about that, haven’t we, Julius?&mdash;I
knew that they would avail me nothing if Waldo
knew the truth. Because I had&mdash;gone wrong!
That would have been a shock; it would have meant
a storm. But&mdash;well, who knows? Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;!
But Arsenio! With Arsenio! They had been great
friends, those two; but in the end&mdash;deep down, there
was antagonism, aversion. The one despised, the
other felt himself despised. Oh, but I know&mdash;look
what I’ve been to them both! And now they were
rivals! Through me! All through Venice Arsenio
had never forgotten Waldo&mdash;nor what Waldo
called him, as I’ve told you. All through Cragsfoot
Waldo never forgot Arsenio. It was not only
Nina who dragged Arsenio in&mdash;though she did.
Waldo used to bring in his name&mdash;and watch me.
He said to me once, in a light way, ‘I suppose you
and our friend Monkey had a picturesque flirtation
at Venice&mdash;gondolas and concerts on the Grand
Canal, and all the rest of it?’ I laughed and said,
‘Of course we had! But I don’t think I found Venice
any more intoxicating than&mdash;well, than Cragsfoot,
Waldo.’ That lifted the cloud from his face. He
took it to himself&mdash;as I meant him to; a bit of self-defensive
tactics! That was by no means the only
time that he tried to draw me about Arsenio. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he never put a single question&mdash;not one&mdash;to Mother.
That was against his code, you know.</p>

<p>“There it all was: the charm of Cragsfoot, the desire
to please, comfort, soreness with Arsenio, anger
at Nina, liking for Waldo&mdash;and the adventure! I
seemed, in the end, to act on an impulse; I suppose
that it was really the outcome of all these
things. But it seemed impulse, and Nina was the
direct&mdash;I mean, the immediate&mdash;cause of it. How
I remember that day!</p>

<p>“She came to lunch at Cragsfoot, and was fairly
agreeable&mdash;for her. After lunch we three were
alone in the smoking room, and she proposed that
Waldo should walk back to Briarmount with her
and play billiards. It was inclining to rain, not attractive
for a long walk. Waldo asked me to come
too. The weather didn’t tempt me; I said no. By
now I was not, of course, in the least afraid of
leaving him alone with Nina. However, he went
on pressing me, and at last I consented. She kept
quiet during the pressing, but I saw the hard look
in her eyes that always meant temper. We started
off, all in our mackintoshes, for the rain was coming
down smartly now. Silence for the first half
mile or so; Nina’s nose was in the air, Waldo was
sullen; I was amused; but I wasn’t going to make
talk for them if they chose to be sulky. Suddenly
she began on Arsenio again. She wished Don Arsenio
was here! What jolly times we had when
Don Arsenio was here! And so on. Neither of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
said anything. Then she said directly to me, across
Waldo, who was walking between us, ‘Don’t you
know where he is? Don’t you ever hear from him?
He was a great admirer of yours.’ I answered
carelessly that I hadn’t heard since he left Venice;
but I felt my color rising. Waldo listened silently,
but I felt him getting annoyed&mdash;I always could.
And I was getting afraid. If we’d been alone, I
could easily have got away from the topic and
smoothed him down. But she was there. ‘Don’t
you miss him too, Waldo? You and he and Lucinda
used to have such fun together!’ I could see that
Waldo was just holding himself in. ‘The Monkey’s
all right,’ he said, ‘but I can live without him, you
know. And I imagine you can too, Lucinda?’ There
was a look on his face that I didn’t like. I saw
that, Nina or no Nina, I must do something. ‘Perfectly!’
I said with a laugh. I put my arm through
his and gave him a little squeeze on his wrist. I
think we’re quite all right as we are, Waldo!’</p>

<p>“We were just at the top of the hill&mdash;where you
turn along the cliff towards Briarmount. Waldo
pressed my arm between his arm and his side, so
that I couldn’t draw it away. He stopped, and
stood facing Nina like that, making me face her
too, with my arm in his like that. ‘Now you understand
our views, and you can drop the subject,’
he said in a low voice; it trembled a little. I felt
very excited; I didn’t know how she would take it,
what she would say; his voice was brusque, angry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
contemptuous. But I wasn’t the least prepared for
what did happen. She stood opposite to us for
a minute, smiling sarcastically, or trying to smile;
then her mouth began to work, and her lips turned
down, and&mdash;she began to cry! Quite loudly&mdash;like
a passionate child. What I’d been through is supposed
to be the greatest humiliation a woman can
go through&mdash;being taken and left. But this that
she was going through seemed to me infinitely worse.
I whispered, ‘Nina!’ and tried to draw my arm
away from Waldo; I felt that I must go to her. He
wouldn’t let me; he held my arm in a vise, and
himself just stood looking at her, pale as pale, absolutely
quiet! She tried to speak, but couldn’t get
any words out, because of her sobbing. She gave
it up, and began to undo her mackintosh, to get her
handkerchief. She found it, and wiped her eyes;
but she was sobbing still. I clung to Waldo now,
for support; my legs were shaking under me; I
didn’t sob, but I felt tears on my cheeks. At last
she threw out her arm towards us, in a threatening
sort of gesture, sobbed out, ‘You’ll be sorry for
this!’ turned away, and hurried off along the cliff
towards Briarmount. Her figure swayed as she
walked. It was very pitiful.</p>

<p>“But Waldo watched her without any sign of
pity&mdash;watched her till she was quite a long way
off. Then he turned to me, put his hands under
my arms and drew me close to him; he covered
my face with kisses&mdash;my face wet with both rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and tears. ‘You love me, you love me, Lucinda?’
he whispered. I didn’t speak; I let him kiss me.
I think I did love him; at any rate, I was completely
overmastered. Now I began to sob myself, just
repeating ‘Waldo! Waldo!’ through my sobs&mdash;nothing
else&mdash;and clinging to him.”</p>

<p>Lucinda came to a stop and then turned her eyes
to mine&mdash;they had been looking into the dimness
of the <i>salle-à-manger</i>&mdash;“So&mdash;it happened,” she said.</p>

<p>She had brought her scene before my eyes vividly
enough&mdash;the three wet, drab, mackintoshed figures
there on the cliff in the rain; the sudden explosion
of misery, spite, and love; the fight between the
two girls; the disaster to one, to the other a victory
that had brought no abiding peace. Yet, as she
talked, there had been also in my mind’s eye another,
a competing, picture. At the same spot&mdash;quite
accidentally the same, or did she haunt it?&mdash;a
tall, stately young woman&mdash;her figure quite ‘finished’
now, no longer lumpy&mdash;a young woman composed,
ironical, verging indeed on the impudent&mdash;yet just
vulnerable, prone to flush, tempted to fib, when the
wedding of Waldo and Lucinda was the topic. I
saw now why she had not been invited to that ceremony.
Her presence would have been awkward for
all parties. The skeleton at the feast indeed&mdash;if the
feast had ever happened! But set against her, the
sobbing girl, with her pitiful passion, her melodramatic
“You’ll be sorry for this”&mdash;thrown out in
the random of fury and spite, but perhaps not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
some subtle instinct, some feminine intuition of
the truth.</p>

<p>“I saw Nina Frost once when I was last in England,”
I said after a long pause. “If you ever
meet her again, you’ll find her a good deal changed.
She’s quite a woman of the world now.”</p>

<p>“She’s the last person in the whole world that I
wish to meet!”</p>

<p>“I understand that. It couldn’t be pleasant for
either of you. Well, probably you never will.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we shall. It isn’t all finished between me
and Nina yet. I had my victory; I threw it away.
I saw her in her awful humiliation; how will she
see me next, I wonder!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that sort of idea very&mdash;well, fanciful, Lucinda?”</p>

<p>She made no reply; the veil had fallen over her
eyes; she gave a little shiver.</p>

<p>“It’s cold here,” I said. “Let’s go where it’s
warm and light&mdash;to the restaurant&mdash;and finish the
evening.” I smiled as I added, “And the story too,
please.”</p>

<p>“I can bring it right up to date. I had a letter
from Arsenio to-day.”</p>

<p>I was conscious of a slight shock of surprise. I
had been thinking of Arsenio as a historical figure&mdash;an
episode in her past. He was, however, also
an existing fact; but what sort of a fact? About
that I was still ignorant.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NEEDLEWOMAN</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">ON the way home I made Waldo promise not
to tell about our engagement till I agreed.
He did promise, but I think he must have
given a pretty strong hint at home. There was
such a wonderful absence of awkward references or
questions. My mother never spoke of Arsenio; Aunt
Bertha refrained from comment when it became
known that Mr. Frost and his daughter had suddenly
gone on a holiday, yachting&mdash;at the very beginning
of what would have been Nina’s first season!
And Sir Paget, besides petting me more than
ever, began to talk to me as if I had a proprietorial
interest in Cragsfoot. Waldo himself was very
gentle and patient with me; he felt that he had
‘rushed’ me, I think, and was anxious not to frighten
me. I believe that the possibility of something like
what did in the end happen was always at the back
of his mind; he never felt secure. There was always
Arsenio; and I was&mdash;unaccountable! So he
soothed and smoothed me, and let me put off the
announcement of the engagement for nearly six
months. We weren’t at Cragsfoot all that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but coming and going between there and London.
Mother took the Mount Street flat then; my opinion
was&mdash;and is&mdash;that Sir Paget or Waldo paid for it.
But, whether in town or country, Waldo and I were
meeting all the time.</p>

<p>“I didn’t announce the engagement because I
didn’t want to burn my boats; and then I did agree
to announce it because I did want to burn my boats!
That was the kind of person I was then&mdash;at all
events, the kind of condition I was in. I had got
over my fears almost entirely. Nina had thrown
up the sponge; Arsenio wouldn’t betray me; Waldo
dreamt of nothing worse than the picturesque flirtation
in a gondola (though he didn’t like even that!).
Nobody could prove, or even plausibly suggest, anything;
unless my own nerve gave way, I was quite
safe. So I thought then, anyhow. And I had almost
got over my sense of guiltiness too. It came
over me now and then; but it didn’t any longer
seem very real; perhaps I had just exhausted my
feelings about it. It wasn’t what I had done which
troubled me all through those long months, both
before the announcement and after it; it was what
I was doing and what I was going to do. I liked
Waldo enormously, and more and more as I knew
him better. In spite of his tempers, he’s a great
gentleman. But he never kissed me, he never took
me in his arms, without my thinking of Arsenio.</p>

<p>“I had the oddest sense that this thing wasn’t
final, that something would occur to end it. I didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
expect to finish it myself, but I expected that something
would. The feeling made me terribly restless;
and it often made me cold and wayward with
Waldo: then I had to be very affectionate to make
him happy again. I liked making him happy, and
I could do it. But I always seemed to be playing
a part. I suppose I loved Arsenio. Love Arsenio
after what had happened! That seemed monstrous.
I wouldn’t open my eyes to it. I wouldn’t
have gone to him if I could. And yet I couldn’t
go happily to Waldo. I felt I was Arsenio’s&mdash;I
wouldn’t own it, but I couldn’t help it. Julius, I believe
that I’m a very primitive woman.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been sounding rather complicated up to
now; I don’t mean&mdash;well, unnatural.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had love affairs, of course. I know
you’ve had one big one. I even know her name;
Aunt Bertha told me.”</p>

<p>“She shouldn’t have done that.”</p>

<p>“I was one of the family then, you see. She
is&mdash;dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some few years ago&mdash;two years before
we met at Cragsfoot.”</p>

<p>“That’s how you come not to have married?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; many men don’t marry. Well&mdash;probably.
But it’s your story we’re after, not mine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but your having had an affair like that may
help you&mdash;may help me to make you understand.
What is it that sometimes seems to tie two people
together in spite of themselves? Arsenio’s coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
back to me was just chance&mdash;chance on chance. He
was in this very place where we are now; in very
low water, living in the little house I’m living in
now, and employed as clerk to a wine merchant.
He had given up all thoughts of me, of coming
back to England. He couldn’t do it; he hadn’t the
money. The English papers hardly ever came his
way. One day a man came in, for a bottle of whisky&mdash;an
Englishman; he had a copy of the <i>Times</i> with
him, and tore off a sheet of it to wrap the bottle
in, and threw the rest on the floor. When he was
gone, Arsenio picked it up and read it. And he
saw the announcement of the date of my wedding&mdash;July
the twenty-first.”</p>

<p>“He told me, that day in London, that he had
already decided to come to England when he saw
that.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t tell you all the truth that day.
This is what happened. Seeing that notice, a queer
fancy took him; he would see whether that number&mdash;my
number he called it&mdash;would bring him luck.
He scraped together some money, went over to
Monte Carlo, and won, won, won! His luck went
to his head; everything seemed possible. He came
straight to England&mdash;to see if the luck held, he
said. You can guess the rest.”</p>

<p>“Pretty well. You must have had a time of it,
though!”</p>

<p>“I think my mind really made itself up the moment
I saw Arsenio. The rest was&mdash;tactics! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
mustn’t see Waldo; I invented excuses. Waldo
mustn’t see Arsenio&mdash;that at all costs! He always
suspected Arsenio, and Arsenio might give it away&mdash;you
know his malicious little airs of triumph when
he scores! You picture me as miserable? No! I
was fearful, terrified. But I was irrepressibly excited&mdash;and
at last happy. My doubt was done
and ended.”</p>

<p>“You were not ashamed?” I ventured.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was ashamed too&mdash;because of Aunt Bertha
and Sir Paget. Because of them, much more
than because of Waldo. They loved me; they had
taken me to be, as it were, their daughter. Between
Waldo and Arsenio it had always been a
fight&mdash;yes, from that first day at Cragsfoot. I
was the prize! But in a way I was also just a spectator.
I mean&mdash;in the end I couldn’t help which
won; something quite out of my power to control
had to decide that. And that something never had
any doubt. How could I go against everything that
was real in me?”</p>

<p>“I think you are rather primitive,” I said. “It
seems to you a fight between the males. You await
the issue. Well&mdash;and what’s happened? I hope
things are&mdash;flourishing now?”</p>

<p>She looked at me with one of her slow-dawning
smiles; evidently, for some reason, she was amused
at me, or at the question which I had put.</p>

<p>“I’ve spent the greater part of the waking hours
of three days with you, Julius. I’ve walked, lunched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and dined with you. I’ve talked to you interminably.
You must have looked at me sometimes,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve looked at you, to tell the truth, a great
deal.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve noticed nothing peculiar?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t use the word ‘peculiar’ to describe
what I’ve noticed.”</p>

<p>“Not, for instance, that I’ve always worn the
same frock?” She was leaning her elbows on the
table now, her chin resting between her hands. “And
what that means to a charming woman&mdash;oh, we
agreed on that!&mdash;invited out by a fine figure of a
man&mdash;&mdash;! And yet you ask if things are flourishing!”</p>

<p>“By Jove, I believe you have! It’s a very pretty
frock, Lucinda. No, but really it is!”</p>

<p>“It’s an old friend&mdash;and my only one. So let’s
speak no evil of it.” Yet she did speak evil of the
poor frock; she whispered, “Oh, how I hate it, hate
it, this old frock!” She gave a little laugh. “If it
came my way, I wonder whether I could resist
splendor! Guilty splendor!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t poor old Waldo present himself to you&mdash;oddly,
I must say&mdash;rather in that light? And
you resisted!”</p>

<p>“I’ve changed. You’re talking to a different
woman&mdash;different from the girl I’ve been boring
you about. The girl I’ve been boring you about
wouldn’t&mdash;couldn’t&mdash;marry Waldo with Arsenio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
there; I&mdash;the I that am&mdash;could and, I think, would.”</p>

<p>“Because of your old friend here?” I touched
lightly the sleeve of her gown.</p>

<p>“For what it has meant, and does mean&mdash;oh, and
for itself too! I’m no heroine. Primitive women
love finery too.”</p>

<p>Her face was untouched by time, or struggle,
or disillusion. Her eyes were as they always had
been, clear, calm, introspective. Only her figure
was more womanly, though still slim; she had not
Nina’s statuesque quality. But the soul within was
changed, it seemed. This train of thought brought
me to an abrupt question: “No child, Lucinda?”</p>

<p>“There was to have been. I fell ill, and&mdash;&mdash;It
was one of the times when our luck was out. Arsenio
made nothing for months. We soon spent
what Number 21 brought us.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that you were&mdash;in want?
At that time!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, I can’t learn all lessons, but I can
learn some. I’ve a trade of my own now.”</p>

<p>I confess that I yielded for a moment to a horrible
suspicion&mdash;an idea that seemed to make my
blood stop. I did not touch her arm this time;
I clasped it roughly. I did not speak.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she said with a little laugh. “But thank
you, dear old Julius. I see that you’d have cared,
that you’d have cared very much. Because I shall
have a bruise there&mdash;and for your sake I’ll kiss it.
I’ve neglected my work for your sake&mdash;or my pleasure&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
last three days. But I work for Madame&mdash;well,
shall we say Madame Chose?&mdash;because
I don’t want you to go and criticize my handiwork
in the window. I embroider <i>lingerie</i>, Julius&mdash;chemises
and pants. There’s a demand for such
things&mdash;yes, even now, on this coast. I was always
a good needlewoman. I used to mend all my things.
Do you remember that on one occasion I was mending
my gloves?”</p>

<p>“But Arsenio?”</p>

<p>“Arsenio pursues Dame Fortune. Sometimes he
catches her for a moment, and she pays ransom.
She buys herself off&mdash;she will not be permanently
his. She’s very elusive. A light-o’-love! Like me?
No, but I’m not.” She leant forward to me, with
a sudden amused gurgle of laughter. “But, you
know, he’s as brave as a lion. He was dying to fight
from the beginning. Only he didn’t know whom
to fight for, poor boy! He wanted to fight for Germany
because she’s monarchical, and against her because
she’s heavy and stupid and rigid and cruel&mdash;and
mainly Protestant!&mdash;and against France because
she’s republican and atheistical&mdash;oh, no less!&mdash;but
for her because she’s chivalrous, and dashing,
and&mdash;well, the <i>panache</i>, you know! He was in a
very difficult position, poor dear Arsenio, till Italy
came in; and even then he had his doubts, because
Austria’s clerical! However, Italy it is!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t England appeal to him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“For England, monsieur, Don Arsenio has now
an illimitable scorn.”</p>

<p>“The devil he has!” said I softly.</p>

<p>She laughed again at that, and something of her
gayety still illuminated her face as she gave me a
warning. “I’ve told you nearly all my secrets&mdash;all
I’m going to tell! If any of them get to that deplorable
England, to that damp, dripping and doleful
Devonshire (the epithets are Arsenio’s!) I’ll
cut you dead. And if they get to&mdash;Briarmount&mdash;I’ll
kill you!”</p>

<p>“I’ll say that you live in a palace, with seven
attendant princes, and seventy-seven handmaids!”</p>

<p>“Yes!” she agreed gleefully. “Who’s that
woman looking for?”</p>

<p>The woman in question was a stout person in a
sort of official uniform. Her eyes traveled over
the few guests at the little restaurant; in her hand
she held a blue envelope. “She’s looking for me.
She’s been sent on from my hotel, depend upon
it,” I said, with a queer sense of annoyance. I, who
had been fuming because my instructions did not
come!</p>

<p>I was right. The woman gave me the envelope
and took my receipt. I made a rapid examination of
my package. “I must be off early to-morrow morning,”
I said to Lucinda.</p>

<p>She did say, “I’m sorry,” but without any sign of
emotion. And the next moment she added, “Because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
you’ll just miss Arsenio. He arrives to-morrow
evening&mdash;to pay me a visit.”</p>

<p>“I think I’m rather glad to miss Arsenio,” I remarked
frankly. “Oh, not because he ran away
with you, and made fools of us all that day, but
because of what you’ve been telling me just now.”</p>

<p>“If you liked him before, you’d like him still.
He hasn’t changed a bit, he’s just as he always was&mdash;very
attractive in his good and gay moods, very
naughty and perverse in his bad ones. Yes, just
the same. And that’s what makes it so unfair in
me to&mdash;to feel as I do about him now. That’s
one of the difficult things about love, isn’t it? And
marriage. The other person may go on being just
what he was&mdash;what you knew he was; but you may
change yourself, and so not like him any more&mdash;at
least, not be content; because there’s a lot about Arsenio
that I still like.” Her eyes now wore their
most self-examining, introspective look.</p>

<p>She pushed her chair back from the table. “It’s
late, and you’ve got to start early. And I must be
early and long at work, to make up for lost time&mdash;if
it’s not rude to call it that.”</p>

<p>I raised my glass. “Then&mdash;to our next meeting!”</p>

<p>“When will that be, I wonder!”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows! I roam up and down the earth,
like the Enemy of Mankind. But, after all, in these
days to be on the earth and not under it, is something.
And you, Lucinda?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose I shall stay here&mdash;with Madame&mdash;Chose.
War or no war, ladies must have <i>lingerie</i>,
mustn’t they?”</p>

<p>“It seems a&mdash;well, a drab sort of life!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes,” said Lucinda. “But one of us must
earn some money, you see. Even if I were that sort
of person&mdash;and I don’t think I am&mdash;I couldn’t
afford to do anything useful or heroic. The pay
for that isn’t high enough.”</p>

<p>I walked to her house with her, according to
our custom&mdash;now of three days’ standing. As we
went, I was summoning up courage for a venture.
When we reached the door I said, “May I let you
know from time to time&mdash;whenever it’s possible&mdash;where
I am? So that, if you were in&mdash;if real occasion
arose, you could write to me and&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall like to hear from you. But I probably
shan’t answer&mdash;unless I’ve something different
to tell you&mdash;different from Madame Chose&mdash;and
better.”</p>

<p>“But if it were&mdash;worse?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t take money from you, if that’s what
you mean. Oh, it’s not your fault, it’s nothing in
you yourself. But you’re a Rillington.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that, again, rather fanciful?”</p>

<p>“You seem to call all my deepest instincts fanciful!”
she protested, smiling. “But that one’s very
deep. Goodness, I could almost as soon conceive
of myself accepting Nina Frost’s cast-off frocks!”</p>

<p>We smiled together over that monstrous freak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of the imagination. And so, still smiling, we parted&mdash;she
to go back to Madame Chose and her <i>lingerie</i>,
I to my wanderings and nosing about. I did from
time to time send her an address that would probably
find me; but, as her words had foreshadowed,
I got no answers. So it was still Madame Chose&mdash;or
worse? I had to suppose that; and I was sorrowful.
She had been much to blame, but somewhat
to be pitied; the root feeling under which she
had in the end acted&mdash;fidelity to the man to whom
she had first belonged&mdash;might be primitive, as she
herself suggested; it did not seem to me ignoble.
At all events, she had not in the end been worldly;
she had not sold herself. No, not yet.</p>

<p>For a while I thought a good deal about her; she
had made a vivid impression on me in those three
days; her face haunted my eyes sometimes. But&mdash;well,
we were all very busy; there was a lot to
think about&mdash;plenty of food both for thought and
for emotion, immediate interests too strong for
memories and speculations to fight against. The
echo of her voice was drowned by the clamor of war.
The vision of her face faded.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">LIKE TO LIKE</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT was in May, 1916, that Waldo got a severe
wound in the right shoulder, which put him
out of action for the rest of the war and sent
him, after two or three months in a hospital, back
to Cragsfoot. He had done very well, indeed distinguished
himself rather notably; had fortune been
kinder, he might have expected to rise to high rank.
The letters which I received&mdash;I was far away, and
was not at the time able to get leave, even had
I felt justified in asking for it&mdash;reflected the mingled
disappointment, anxiety, and relief, which the end
of his military career, the severity of his wound,
and his return home&mdash;alive, at all events!&mdash;naturally
produced at Cragsfoot.</p>

<p>Sir Paget wrote seldom and briefly, but with a
quiet humor and an incisive touch. Aunt Bertha’s
letters&mdash;especially now that she had only me to
write to, and no longer spent the larger part of her
epistolary energy on Waldo&mdash;were frequent, full,
vivid, and chatty. But she was also very discursive;
she would sandwich in the Kaiser between the cook
and the cabbages, Waldo’s wound between Bethmann-Hollweg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and Mr. Winston Churchill. It was,
however, possible to gather from her, aided by Sir
Paget, a pretty complete picture of what was going
on both at Cragsfoot and at Briarmount.</p>

<p>For at Briarmount too anxiety reigned, and the
times were critical. As might be expected of him,
Mr. Jonathan Frost had wrought marvels during
the war. The whole of his vast establishments had
been placed at the disposal of the Ministry of Munitions;
he had effected wonders of rapid adaptation
and transformation, wonders of organization
and output; he “speeded up” a dozen Boards and
infused his own restless energy into somnolent offices.
But two years of these exertions, on the top
of a life of gigantic labor, proved too much even
for him. He won a peerage, but he gave his life.
In the September of that same year he came back
to Briarmount, the victim of a stroke, a dying man.
His mind was still clear and active, but he had considerable
difficulty in speaking, and was unable to
move without assistance. His daughter, who had
sedulously nursed him through his labors, was now
nursing him through the last stage of his earthly
course.</p>

<p>But there was also a newcomer at Briarmount, a
frequent visitor there during the last months of its
master’s life, one in whom both Aunt Bertha and
Sir Paget took considerable interest. This was Captain
Godfrey Frost. Lord Dundrannan (he took
his title from a place he had in Scotland) was old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
enough not to approve of confiding to
women the exclusive command of great interests;
they lacked the broad view and the balance of mind,
however penetrating their intuitions might on occasion
be! And too much power was not good for
them; he even seemed to have hinted to Sir Paget
that they were quite masterful enough already!
That he meant to leave his daughter handsomely,
indeed splendidly, endowed, was certain; but he was
minded to provide himself with an heir male in the
person of this young man. It would have been natural,
perhaps, to suspect him of planning a match
between the cousins, but this did not seem to be
in his head&mdash;perhaps because such personal matters
as marriages held a small place in his mind;
perhaps because he suspected that his daughter’s
ideas on that subject were already settled; perhaps
because his nephew was somewhat too young and&mdash;from
a social point of view&mdash;unformed to be a good
mate for his accomplished daughter.</p>

<p>Captain Frost was, in fact, inexperienced and
backward, shy and rather silent, in society; but unquestionably
he had a full share of the family business
ability&mdash;so much so that, when Lord Dundrannan
“cracked up,” he was brought back from the
front (against his protests, it is only fair to add),
and put in charge, actual if not always nominal, of a
great part of the important activities on which his
uncle had been engaged. His disposition appeared
to be simple, amiable, and unassuming. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
pleasantly deferential to Sir Paget, rather afraid
of Aunt Bertha’s acute eyes, cordial and attentive
to Waldo. Towards Nina he was content to accept
the position of pupil and <i>protégé</i>; he let her put him
through his social paces; he regarded her with evident
respect and admiration, and thought her worthy
to be her father’s daughter&mdash;more than that
he could not do! There was no trace of any sentiment
beyond this, or different in kind from it.
There was, in fact, to be detected in Aunt Bertha’s
letters an underlying note of satisfaction; it might
be described in the words, “He’s quite nice, but
there’s nothing to fear!”</p>

<p>But if such a note as that were really to be heard
in Aunt Bertha’s letters, it could mean only one
thing; and it marked a great change in her attitude
towards Nina. It meant that she was looking forward
with contentment, apparently with actual
pleasure, to a match between Nina and Waldo.
Other signs pointed in the same direction&mdash;her mention
of Nina’s frequent calls at Cragsfoot, of her
kindness to Waldo, of her devotion to her father,
of her praiseworthy calm and level-headedness during
this trying time. The change had perhaps
started from a reaction against Lucinda; after the
first impulse of sympathy with the distracted fugitive
(a very real one at the time) had died down,
Lucinda’s waywardness, her “unaccountability,” presented
themselves in a less excusable light. But the
main cause lay, no doubt, in Waldo himself. Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Bertha was&mdash;passing impulses apart&mdash;for Waldo
and on his side. Any shifting of her views and
feelings in a matter like this would be certain to reflect
a similar alteration in his attitude.</p>

<p>In November a letter from Sir Paget told me of
Lord Dundrannan’s death, at which, by chance, he
was himself present; evidently moved by the scene,
he recounted it with more detail than he was wont
to indulge in. Hearing that his neighbor was worse,
he went to inquire; as he stood at the door, Nina
drove up in her car&mdash;she had been out for an airing&mdash;and
took him into the library where her father
was, sitting in a chair by the fire. It was very rarely
that he would consent to keep his bed, and he had
insisted on getting up that day. “Godfrey Frost
was there” (my uncle wrote) “and Dr. Napier,
standing and whispering together in the window.
By the sick man sat an old white-haired Wesleyan
minister, whom he had sent for all the way from
Bradford, where he himself was born: he had ‘sat
under’ this old gentleman as a boy, and a few days
before had expressed a great longing to see him.
The minister was reading the Bible to him now.
It looked as though he had foreseen that the end
was coming. He had had a sort of valedictory talk
with Nina and young Frost a week before&mdash;about
the money and the businesses, what they were to do,
what rules they were to be guided by, and so on.
That done, he appeared to dismiss worldly affairs,
this world itself, from his thoughts, and ‘took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>’
the next. I am not mocking; yet I can hardly help
smiling. He seemed to have ‘taken it up’ in the
same way that he would have inquired into a new,
important and interesting speculation; and he got
his expert&mdash;the old minister from Bradford&mdash;to advise
him. He was not afraid, or agitated, or remorseful;
his feelings seemed, so far as his impaired
speech enabled him to describe them to his family,
those of a curious and earnest interest in his prospects
of survival&mdash;he eagerly desired to survive&mdash;and
in what awaited him if he did survive. The
fact that he had neglected religion for a great many
years back did not trouble him; nor did ‘How hardly
shall a rich man&mdash;&mdash;’ He seemed confident that,
if immortality were a fact, some place and some
work would be found for Jonathan Frost. Whether
it was a fact was what he wanted to know; he hated
the idea of nothingness, of inactivity, of stopping!</p>

<p>“The old minister shut his book when I came in.
Nina led me up to her father. He recognized me
and smiled. I said a few words, but I doubt if he
listened. He pointed towards the book on the minister’s
knee&mdash;he could move his left hand&mdash;and
tried to say something: I think that he was trying
to pursue the subject that engrossed him, perhaps
to get my opinion on it. But the next moment he
gave a smothered sort of cry&mdash;not loud at all&mdash;and
moved his hand towards his heart. Napier darted
across the room to him; Nina put her arm round
his neck and kissed him. He gave a sigh, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
head fell back on her arm. He was gone&mdash;all in
a minute&mdash;gone to get the answer to his question.
Then there was a ringing of bells, of course, and
they came in and took him way. Nina put her
hands in mine for a second before she followed them
out of the room: ‘My dear father!’ she said. Then
she put her arm in young Frost’s, and he led her
out of the room, very gently, in a very gentleman-like
way, I must say. I was left alone with the old
minister. ‘The end of a remarkable life!’ I said,
or something of that sort. ‘I’m glad it came so
easily at the end.’ He bowed his white head. ‘He
did great things for his country,’ he answered.
‘God’s ways are not our ways, Sir Paget.’ I said
good-by, and left him with his book.”</p>

<p>A month after Lord Dundrannan’s death I got
Christmas leave, came to England, and went down
to Cragsfoot on the Friday before Christmas Day;
it fell on a Monday that year. It was jolly to be
there again, and to find old Waldo out of danger
and getting on really famously.</p>

<p>But how he was changed! I will not go into
the physical changes&mdash;they proved, thank God, in
the main temporary, though it was a long time before
he got back nearly all his old vigor&mdash;but I
can’t help speculating on how much they, and the
suffering they brought, had to do with the change in
the nature of the man. Perhaps nothing; it is, I
suppose, rather an obscure subject, a medical question;
but I cannot help thinking that they worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
together with his other experiences. At least, they
must have made him in a way older in body, just
as the other experiences made him older in mind. I
never realized till then&mdash;though I ought to have&mdash;how
very little I had really been through, in what
had seemed two tolerably exciting and exhausting
years, compared to him who had “stuck it through”
all the time at the front. I said something of this
sort to him as we gossiped together, and it set him
talking.</p>

<p>“Well, old chap,” he said, laughing, “I don’t
know how you found it&mdash;you were, of course, a
grown man, a man of the world, before it all began&mdash;but
I just had to change. It’s no credit to me&mdash;I
had to! I was a cub, a puppy&mdash;I had to become a
trained animal. As it was, that infernal temper of
mine nearly cost me my commission in the first three
months. It would have, by Jove, if Tom Winter&mdash;my
Company Commander&mdash;hadn’t been the best
fellow in the world; he was killed six months later,
poor chap, but he’d got a muzzle on me before that.
You will find me a bit better there; I haven’t had
a real old break-out ever since.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I daresay you will, when you get fit!” said
I consolingly.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he laughed again. “But I don’t
want to, you know. They were a bit upsetting to
everybody concerned.” He smiled as though in a
gentle amusement at his old self. “Only father
could manage me&mdash;and he couldn’t always. Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
I was impossible! I might have committed a
murder one fine day!”</p>

<p>I recollected a certain fine day on which murder,
or something very like it, was certainly his purpose.
Oh, with a good deal of excuse, no doubt!</p>

<p>Perhaps his thoughts had moved in the same direction;
seeing me again might well have that effect
on him.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to exaggerate things. I daresay
I’ve a bit of the devil left in me. And I don’t
know whether men in general have been affected
much by the business. Some have, some haven’t, I
expect. Perhaps I’m a special case. The war
came at what was for me a very critical moment.
For me personally it was a lucky thing, in spite of
this old shoulder; and it was lucky that my father
was so clear about its coming. I was saved from
myself, by Jove, I was!”</p>

<p>The “self” of whom he spoke came back to my
memory as strangely different and apart from the
languid, tranquil man who was talking to me on the
long invalid’s chair. He reclined there, smiling
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I bear no malice against the girl,” he went on.
“It was my mistake. She went to her own in the
end; it was inevitable that she should; and better
before marriage&mdash;even just before!&mdash;than after.
Like to like&mdash;she and Monkey Valdez!”</p>

<p>Though I had my own views as to that, I held my
tongue. If once I let out that I had seen Lucinda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
one question&mdash;if not from Waldo, at any rate from
Aunt Bertha&mdash;would lead to another, and I should
be in danger of betraying the needlewoman’s secret.
I had made up my mind to lie if need be, but if I
kept silence, it was a hundred to one that it would
not occur to any one at Cragsfoot to ask whether I
had seen Lucinda. Why should I have seen her?
It never did occur to any of the three of them; I was
asked no questions.</p>

<p>“The best thing to be hoped is that we never run
up against one another again. I might still be
tempted to give the Monkey a thrashing! Oh, I
forgot&mdash;I don’t suppose I shall ever be able to give
anybody a thrashing! Sad thought, Julius! Well,
there it is&mdash;let’s forget ‘em!” A gesture of his
sound arm waved Lucinda and her Monkey into
oblivion.</p>

<p>So be it. I changed the subject. “Very sad
about poor old Frost. Dundrannan, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, poor old boy! For a week or two it was
about even betting between him and me&mdash;which of
us would win out, I mean. Well, I have; and he’s
gone. We didn’t half do him justice in the old days.
Really a grand man, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>I agreed. Lord Dundrannan&mdash;Jonathan Frost&mdash;had
always filled me with the sort of admiration
that a non-stop express inspires; and Sir Paget’s
letter had added a pathetic touch to the recollection
of him&mdash;made him more of a human being, brought
him into relation with Something that he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
create; that, in fact, I suppose, created him. Really
quite a new aspect of Lord Dundrannan!</p>

<p>“She’s come through it splendidly,” said Waldo.</p>

<p>“What, Miss Nina?”</p>

<p>Waldo laughed. “Look here, old chap, you
don’t seem to be up to date. Been in Paraguay or
Patagonia, or somewhere, have you? She’s not
‘Miss Nina’&mdash;she’s my Lady Dundrannan.”</p>

<p>“Nobody told me that there was a special remainder
to her!”</p>

<p>“Well, he’d done wonders. He was old and ill.
No son! They could hardly refuse it him, could
they? The peerage would have been an empty gift
without it.”</p>

<p>“Lady Dundrannan! Lady Dundrannan!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it right now, Julius. Of Dundrannan
in the county of Perth, and of Briarmount in
the county of Devon&mdash;to give it its full dignity.”</p>

<p>“I expect she’s pleased with it?”</p>

<p>“We’re all human. I think she is. Besides, she
was very fond and proud of her father, and likes to
have her share in carrying on his fame.”</p>

<p>“And she has wherewithal to gild the title!”</p>

<p>“Gilt and to spare! But only about a third of
what he had. A third to her, a third to public objects,
a third to Godfrey Frost. That’s about it&mdash;roughly.
But business control to Godfrey, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Does she like that?” I asked.</p>

<p>He laughed again&mdash;just a little reluctantly, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
thought. “Not altogether, perhaps. But she accepts
it gracefully, and takes it out of the young man
by ordering him about! He’s a surprisingly decent
young chap; she’ll lick him into shape in no time.”</p>

<p>“From what Aunt Bertha said, you and she have
made great friends?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have now.” He paused a moment.
“She was a bit difficult at first. You see, there were
things in the past&mdash;&mdash;Oh, well, never mind that&mdash;it’s
all over.”</p>

<p>There were things in the past; there were: that
group of three on the top of the cliffs; the girl sobbing
wildly, furiously, shamefully; the man holding
the other girl’s arm in his as in a vise of iron.
Meeting Nina again may well have been a bit difficult
at first! It was also a bit difficult to adjust
one’s vision to Baroness Dundrannan and Madame
Chose’s needlewoman, to re-focus them. How
would they feel about one another now? Lucinda
had found some pity for the sobbing girl; would
Lady Dundrannan find the like for the needlewoman?</p>

<p>Or would Waldo himself? In spite of the new
gentleness that there was in his manner, taken as a
whole, there had been an acidity, a certain sharpness
of contempt, in his reference to Lucinda. “That
girl”&mdash;“like to like”&mdash;“she and Monkey Valdez.”
It was natural, perhaps, but&mdash;the question would
not be suppressed&mdash;was it quite the tone of that
“great gentleman” whom Lucinda herself still held
in her memory?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>I was content to drop the subject. “Your father’s
looking splendid,” I remarked, “but Aunt Bertha
seems to me rather fagged.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Bertha’s been fretting a dashed sight too
much over me&mdash;that’s the fact.” He smiled as he
went on. “Well, I’m out of it for good and all,
they tell me&mdash;if I need telling&mdash;and I suppose I
ought to be sorry for it. But really I’m so deuced
tired, that&mdash;&mdash;! Well, I just want to lie here and
be looked after.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll get that!” I assured him confidently.
There was Aunt Bertha to do it; Aunt Bertha, at all
events. Possibly there was somebody else who
would do it even more efficiently.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">HER LADYSHIP</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">“YES,” said my uncle, as he warmed himself
before the library fire, “a young man of very
considerable ability, I think. One might
trust old Jonathan Frost to make no mistake about
that. He might be led by family feeling&mdash;but not
led astray! Hard-headed, and ambitious&mdash;for
himself, I mean, apart from his business, the boy is.
He’s different from the old man in that; the old man
thought of nothing but his undertakings, he was just
the most important part of their machinery. This
boy’s got his eye on politics, he tells me. I’ve no
doubt he’ll get on in them. Then, with a suitable
wife&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lady Arabella&mdash;or something of that sort?”</p>

<p>“Precisely. You catch my train of thought,
Julius.” Sir Paget smiled his shrewdly reflective
smile, as he continued:</p>

<p>“We may regard the Frost family, then, as made&mdash;in
both its branches. Because my lady, with her
possessions and her looks, is undoubtedly made already&mdash;indeed,
ready-made.</p>

<p>We must move with the times&mdash;or at any rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
after them. You’ve done it; you’re a commercial
man yourself, and doing very well at it, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I hope to&mdash;after the war. I believe Sir Ezekiel
means to keep me at home and put me in charge in
London&mdash;if London’s still standing, I mean, of
course. But I don’t feel it in my bones to rival the
kin of Jonathan Frost.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;a remarkable family. What do you make
of the girl herself?”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen a lot more of her than I have.
What do you?”</p>

<p>“Brain above the average, but nothing wonderful.
Will very strong&mdash;she’s as tenacious as a limpet.”</p>

<p>“I should think so. But she’s got her feelings
too, hasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“That’s the point on which I have some doubt.
Well, study her for yourself. I think she’s worth
it.” He was frowning a little as he spoke, as
though his doubt troubled him, although he could
give no very good reason for it. “However, she
has lots of good qualities&mdash;lots,” he ended. He
gave the impression of a man trying to reconcile
himself to something, and finding his task difficult.
He praised the Frost family in handsomely general
terms, with hardly a reservation; yet with just the
hint of one. It was as though Nina&mdash;and her
cousin too, for that matter&mdash;just failed to give him
complete satisfaction, just lacked something that his
nature or his taste needed. I did not think that it
was anything very serious&mdash;not anything that could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
be called moral, a matter of lack of virtue or
presence of vice. It was rather a dourness, too
much solidity, too little gayety, humor, responsiveness.
The Frosts were perhaps not “out of working
harness” enough. Did his mind insist on drawing
a contrast? He had loved the girl of whom we
did not speak.</p>

<p>Aunt Bertha’s attitude was different, as her letters
had suggested. Her acute and eminently practical
mind wasted no time in pining for ideals, or in indulging
delicate dissatisfactions. It preferred to
concentrate on the pleasant aspects of the attainable.
One can’t expect everything in this world! And
it may even be doubted whether the softer charms,
the insidious fascinations, are desirable attributes in
women (men, of course, never possess them, so that
the question doesn’t arise there); don’t they bring
more trouble than good to their possessors, or anyhow
to other people? (To her dear Waldo?)</p>

<p>Perhaps they do. At any rate, it was by hints of
this order that Aunt Bertha, having seen reason
herself, sought to overcome the lingering sentimentalities,
and perhaps memories, of Sir Paget.</p>

<p>“The kindness of the girl!” said Aunt Bertha.
“All through her own trouble&mdash;and you know how
she loved her father!&mdash;she never forgot us and our
anxiety. She used to manage to see me almost
every day; came with grapes&mdash;you know the Briarmount
grapes?&mdash;or something, for Waldo, and
cheered me up with a little talk. She may not gush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
she may not splash about, but Nina has a heart of
gold, Julius.”</p>

<p>“Then she’s gold all through, inside and out,” I
said, rather flippantly.</p>

<p>“Men are often fools,” Aunt Bertha remarked&mdash;and
I hope that the observation may be considered
irrelevant. “They undervalue the real things that
matter in a woman.”</p>

<p>“What’s the application of that? I’m sure that
Waldo likes Lady Dundrannan very much.”</p>

<p>“Of course he does. And whatever my remark
meant, it didn’t mean that Waldo is a fool. Waldo
has grown a great deal wiser than he was. And
for that very reason you’re turning up your nose at
him, Julius!”</p>

<p>There her acumen came in. She defined in a
single homely sentence the mental attitude against
which I was struggling. It was true. I collapsed
before Aunt Bertha’s attack.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best to fall in love with her myself,”
I promised.</p>

<p>“It won’t make any difference what you try,” was
the best I got out of her in return for my concession.</p>

<p>All the same, her emotional <i>volte-face</i> continued
to surprise me. She might, perhaps, well forget
that she had loved and pitied Lucinda. Was it&mdash;well,
decent&mdash;so entirely to forget that she had once
heartily disliked Nina, and to call me a fool on the
score that my feelings were the same as hers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
been not much more than two years before? Besides,
I did not dislike Nina. I merely failed (as
Sir Paget failed) to find in her certain characteristics
which in my judgment lend charm and grace to
a woman. I tried to explain this to Aunt Bertha;
she sniffed and went on knitting.</p>

<p>The young man, Captain Frost, anyhow, I did
like; I took to him at once, and he, I think, to me.
He was spending a brief Christmas holiday at Briarmount,
with a certain Mrs. Haynes, a friend of
Nina’s, for company or <i>chaperon</i> to the cousins. He
was a tall, straight fellow, with a bright blue eye and
fair curly hair. There was an engaging candor
about him; he was candid about things as to which
men are often not candid with one another&mdash;about
his stupendous good luck and how he meant to take
advantage of it; his ambitions and how he could best
go about to realize them; his extremely resolute purpose
to let nothing interfere with his realizing them.
He was even candid about his affairs of the heart;
and this was supreme candor, because it lay in confessing
to me&mdash;an elder man to whom he would wish
to appear mature at least, if not <i>rusé</i>&mdash;that he had
never had any; a thing, as every man of the world
knows (God forgive them!) much harder for any
young man to own to than it would be to plead
guilty to&mdash;or to boast of&mdash;half a dozen.</p>

<p>“But why haven’t you?” I couldn’t help asking.
He was himself attractive, and he was not, I fancied,
insusceptible to beauty; for example, he admired his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
cousin&mdash;at the respectful distance which her Ladyship
set between them.</p>

<p>“Well, up to now I couldn’t have afforded to
marry,” was his reply, given in all seriousness, as
though it were perfectly explanatory, perfectly adequate.
But it was so highly revealing that comment
on it is needless.</p>

<p>“Well, now you can,” I said&mdash;I am afraid a little
tartly.</p>

<p>“Yes; but it’s a matter needing careful consideration,
isn’t it? An awful thing if a man makes a
mistake!” His eyes, bright and blue, fixed themselves
on mine in a glance which I felt to be “meaning.”
“Your cousin, for instance, Major Rillington,
was very nearly let in, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know about that, do you? Was it
Lady Dundrannan who told you?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Oh, no! It was Miss Fleming.
And she didn’t tell me anything about who it was&mdash;only
just that he’d had a lucky escape from a girl
quite unworthy of him. She said I must remember
the affair&mdash;it was all over London just before the
war. But as I was in the works at Dundee at the
time, and never read anything in the papers except
racing and football, I somehow missed it; and when
I asked Nina about it, she shut me up&mdash;told me not
to talk scandal.”</p>

<p>“But I thought that she was fitting you for polite
society!”</p>

<p>“That’s good&mdash;jolly good, Captain Rillington!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>”
he was kind enough to say. “I shall tell Nina that;
it’ll amuse her.”</p>

<p>He seemed disposed to take me for a Mentor&mdash;to
think that I might supplement the social education
which his cousin proposed to give him; that I might
do the male, the club side, while she looked after the
drawing-room department&mdash;or deportment. On
the other hand, he instructed me rather freely on
business, until he happened to gather&mdash;from Sir
Paget&mdash;that in the piping times of peace I held a
fairly good position in Ezekiel Coldston &amp; Co., Ltd.;
after which he treated me, if not with a greater, yet
with a more comprehensive, respect. “That’s a big
concern,” he remarked thoughtfully. “Of course
you and we don’t come into competition at all&mdash;quite
separate fields, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” said I, tacitly thanking heaven for
the fact.</p>

<p>As I have said, an engaging young man, and interesting.
I wondered what he and life would make
of one another, when they became better acquainted.
Meanwhile our intimacy increased apace.</p>

<p>Human nature is, and apparently always has been,
prone to poke fun at newly acquired greatness; I
suppose that it hangs on the person stiffly, like a
frock coat fresh from the tailor’s. If Lady Dundrannan
wore her dignity and power rather consciously,
she also wore them well. She made an imposing
figure in her mourning; but her stateliness was
pleasantly and variously tempered to suit the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in which she found herself. For Aunt Bertha
and Sir Paget there was an infusion of the daughterly;
for Captain Godfrey of the elder-sisterly. I
myself still found in her that piquant directness of
approach which, in an earlier moment of temerity, I
have ventured to call her impudence; it seasoned
and animated her grandeur. She was, behind her
dignity, mockingly confidential; she shared a half-hidden
joke with me. She was naturally impelled
to share it, if there were anybody with whom she
could; it was to her the spice of the situation. Not
the situation itself, of course; that was to her entirely
serious and all important; she was attached to
Waldo with all her limpet tenacity, with all her
solidity of purpose, with all the tenderness, moreover,
of which her heart was capable; finally, with
an intensity of straight downright passion, of which
I know by hearsay, but should hardly have divined
from her own demeanor. But the joke, though not
the situation itself, was a lively element in it. She
could not share it with Waldo, or Aunt Bertha, or
Sir Paget; nor would she share it with young Godfrey
Frost, since it hardly became the status of an
elder sister. But she could and did share it with me.
The joke, of course, was Lucinda.</p>

<p>It would have been a still better joke, had she
known all that I knew about Madame Valdez, or
Donna Lucinda Valdez, or Madame Chose’s needlewoman;
she might not have been so ready to share
it with me, had she known that I knew about the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
on the cliffs, passionately, shamefully sobbing in
wounded love, pride, and spite. As matters stood
to her knowledge, the joke was good enough, and
yet fit to share. For here was she&mdash;the uninvited
skeleton at the abortive feast&mdash;triumphant, in possession
of the field, awaiting in secure serenity the
fruition of her hopes. And so placed, moreover,
that the attainment of her object involved no stooping;
a queen bowing acquiescence from her throne
is not said to stoop. Yes, here she was; here she
was, with a vengeance; and&mdash;where was Lucinda?</p>

<p>Well, that was just what she wanted to know. Not
in any uneasiness or apprehension, but in good,
straight, honest, human, feminine curiosity and
malice. Moreover, that was what, before we had
been much together, she came to have a suspicion, an
inkling, that I could tell her&mdash;if I would. This was
no marvel of feminine intuition. It was my fault,
or my mischief. It was my side of the joke, without
which the joke would have been to me rather a grim
one. I could not help playing with her curiosity, inciting
and balking her malice.</p>

<p>She used to come to see Waldo almost every day,
sitting with him an hour or more. Being a young
woman of active habits, she generally came on foot,
and, since he could not escort her home, that duty
fell to my lot; we had several walks back from
Cragsfoot to Briarmount, just as twilight began to
fall on those winter evenings, her clear-cut, handsome
features still showing up boldly above her rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
dark furs. She really looked very much My Lady!</p>

<p>But it is one walk that stands out conspicuous in
memory. It was the afternoon on which Waldo
had asked her to be his wife&mdash;though I did not know
it.</p>

<p>Up to now, when I had occasion to pronounce her
name, I had called her Lady Dundrannan, and she
had not protested, although she continued to use my
Christian name, as she always had since Waldo, Arsenio,
and Lucinda set the example. But on this
day, when her title happened to fall from my lips,
she turned to me with an amused smile:</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you might call me Nina? You
used to. And, really, mayn’t I almost be considered
one of the family now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about calling you Nina just because
I used to, or just because you’re almost one of the
family, Lady Dundrannan&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There you go again!” she protested.</p>

<p>“Well, I rather admire the name. It sounds
wild, feudal, Caledonian. But I’ll call you Nina if
you like me well enough.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always liked you quite well, though I don’t
think you used to like me much.”</p>

<p>“Let bygones be bygones, Nina!”</p>

<p>“Well, they are, aren’t they?” she said, with quite
undisguised meaning&mdash;and undisguised triumph too.
I was stupid not to suspect the cause. “But I believe
you’re sorry for it!”</p>

<p>“I was sorry for it, of course, at the time it happened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
We were all of us&mdash;well, much more than
sorry. Stunned! Aghast!”</p>

<p>“You do use big words over that girl,” remarked
Lady Dundrannan.</p>

<p>“You’re letting yourself go this evening! Hitherto
you’ve been more subtle in trying to get at what I
think&mdash;or thought&mdash;of Lucinda.” Mark my own
subtlety here! I substituted “thought” for “think”;
and what she had been trying to get at was not what
I thought of Lucinda, but what I knew about her&mdash;if
anything. But I meant to lead her on; I gave her
a smile with the words.</p>

<p>“If you felt all that about it, I should have
thought you’d have tried to get some explanation
out of her&mdash;or him. Something to comfort the
family! You yourself might have acted as a go-between.”</p>

<p>“But they vanished.”</p>

<p>“Oh, people don’t vanish so completely as all
that!”</p>

<p>“There’s the war, you know. We’ve all been
busy. No time for useless curiosity.” I did not
advance these pleas in a very convincing tone.</p>

<p>She looked at me suspiciously. “You’ve never
heard a word from either of them?”</p>

<p>I took it that she meant to ask if I had received
any letters. “Never,” said I&mdash;upon the assumption,
truthfully.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose Arsenio Valdez is?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where he is. Fighting for Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
I suppose. He was bound to end by doing that,
though, of course, he’s by way of being a tremendous
Clerical. In with the Black Nobility at Venice, you
see.”</p>

<p>“Nobility, indeed! A scamp like that!”</p>

<p>Now she had no particular reason for enmity
against Valdez; rather the contrary. But Waldo
had, and she reflected Waldo, just as I thought that
Waldo’s flavor of bitterness towards Lucinda reflected
her quality of mind, the sharp edge of her
temper.</p>

<p>“How do you account for what she did?” she
asked me, with a touch of irritation and restlessness.</p>

<p>“‘Account for it!’ Love is unaccountable, isn’t
it?” I remembered that Lucinda had used the
words about herself.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t her mother ever hear from her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’m not in touch with that excellent
woman. She has, I fancy, vanished from
the ken of Cragsfoot as completely as her daughter.”</p>

<p>“I expect they’ve just gone under, that pair&mdash;Lucinda
and Arsenio. Because they were just a pair,
weren’t they?”</p>

<p>I seemed to hear an echo of Waldo’s “like to
like.” Or more probably Waldo’s “like to like”
was an echo of what I now heard.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t see why they should have. We may
very likely knock up against them some day,” I remarked
with a laugh.</p>

<p>It was still light enough for me to see a flash in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
her eyes as she turned quickly on me. “If you
think I’m&mdash;&mdash;” she exclaimed impetuously; but she
pulled herself up, and ended with a scornful little
laugh.</p>

<p>But of course she had not pulled herself up in
time; I knew that she had been going to say “afraid,”
and she knew that I knew it. Lucinda had avowed
a feeling that it was not all over between herself and
Nina yet. Something of a similar feeling seemed to
find a place in Lady Dundrannan’s mind; she contemplated
the possibility of another round in the
fight&mdash;and she was not afraid of it. Or was she?
Just a little&mdash;in her heart? I did not think that she
need be, seeing the sort of man that Waldo was,
knowing (as I now knew) Lucinda’s mind; knowing
too, alas, Lucinda’s fate. But it was curious to find
the same foreboding&mdash;if one could call it that&mdash;in
both women.</p>

<p>“I really don’t see why you should think any more
about Lucinda,” I said.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I need,” she agreed, with a smile
that was happy, proud, and confident.</p>

<p>I looked her in the face, and laughed. She
stopped, and held out her hand to me. As I took it
she went on. “Yes, Waldo is telling the old people
down there, and I’ll tell you here. We’re engaged,
Julius; Waldo asked me this afternoon, and I said
yes.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will believe that I congratulate you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and him very sincerely, and, if I may, gladly welcome
you into the family.”</p>

<p>“Without any <i>arrière-pensée</i>?” Her challenge
was gay and good-humored.</p>

<p>“Absolutely! Why do you suspect anything
else?”</p>

<p>“Well then, because you are&mdash;or were&mdash;fond of
Lucinda.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve got it out at last! But, even supposing
so&mdash;and I’ve no reason for denying it&mdash;I’m
not put to a choice between you, am I? Now at all
events!”</p>

<p>“No,” she admitted, but with a plain touch of
reluctance; she laughed at it herself, perhaps at her
failure to conceal it. “Anyhow, you’ll try to like
me, won’t you, Cousin Julius?”</p>

<p>“I do like you, my dear&mdash;and not a bit less because
you don’t like Lucinda. So there!”</p>

<p>By now we were at the gates of Briarmount. I
pointed to the house.</p>

<p>“You’ve got somebody else to tell your news to,
in there. And you’d better tell him directly. I
hope he’s not been cherishing vain hopes himself,
poor boy!”</p>

<p>“Godfrey?” She laughed again. “Oh, nonsense!
He’s just my little brother.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got two men to manage now. Your
hands will be full, Nina.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I shall be equal to the task!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“And, when you want, you can still unburden your
mind to me about Lucinda.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ve done that! I shall take your advice
and think no more about her. Good-night, Julius.
I&mdash;I’m very happy!”</p>

<p>I watched her walk briskly up the Briarmount
drive in the dusk. Certainly a fine figure of a girl;
and one who improved on acquaintance. I liked
her very much that afternoon. But she certainly
did not like Lucinda! Put as mildly as possible, it
came to that.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">DUNDRANNANIZATION</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">THE family history during the rest of the war&mdash;up
to the Armistice, that is&mdash;will go into
a brief summary. Waldo was discharged
from the army, as permanently unfit for service,
early in 1917. His wedding took place in February
of that year. It was solemnized not at St. George’s,
Hanover Square, but in the country, from the bride’s
seat of Briarmount. I was not present, as I went
abroad again almost directly after my Christmas
visit to Cragsfoot, the salient features of which have
already been indicated. All good fortune waited
on the happy pair (here I rely on Aunt Bertha’s information,
not having had the means of personal
observation), and Nina became the mother of a fine
baby in December. The child was a girl; a little bit
of a disappointment, perhaps; the special remainder
did not, of course, go beyond the present Baroness
herself, and a prospective Lord Dundrannan was
naturally desired. However, there was no need to
pull a long face over that; plenty of time yet, as
Aunt Bertha consolingly observed.</p>

<p>Finally, Captain Godfrey Frost&mdash;who must, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
suppose, now be considered a member of the Rillington-cum-Dundrannan
family and was certainly
treated as one&mdash;made such a to-do in the influential
quarters to which he had access, that at last he was
restored to active service, sent to the Near East,
and made the Palestine campaign with great credit.
The moment that its decisive hour was over, however,
he was haled back again. It may be remembered
that there was a Ministry of Reconstruction,
and it appeared (from Aunt Bertha again) that no
Reconstruction worth mentioning could be undertaken,
or at all events make substantial progress,
without the help of Captain Frost. If that view
be correct, it may help to explain some puzzles; because
Captain Frost got malaria on his way home,
and had to knock off all work, public and private,
for two or three months&mdash;just at the time that was
critical for Reconstruction, no doubt.</p>

<p>That is really all there is to say, though it may
be worth while to let a letter to me from Sir Paget
throw a little sidelight on the progress of affairs:</p>

<p>“Our married couple seem in complete tune with
one another. Congreve says somewhere&mdash;in <i>The
Double Dealer</i>, if I remember rightly&mdash;‘Though
marriage makes man and wife one flesh, it leaves
them still two fools.’ Agreed; but he might have
added (if he hadn’t known his business too well to
spoil an epigram by qualifications) that it doesn’t
leave them quite the same two fools. I have generally
observed (I would say always, except that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
diplomatist of seventy has learnt never to say always)
that when Mr. Black marries Miss White,
either she darkens or he pales. The stronger infuse
its color into the weaker&mdash;or, if you like to
vary the metaphor, there is a partial absorption of
the weaker by the stronger. Excuse this prosing;
there is really nothing to do in the country, you
know! And perhaps you will guess how I came by
this train of reflection. In fact, I think that Waldo&mdash;about
the happiest fellow in the world, and how
good that he should be, after all he has gone
through!&mdash;is experiencing a partial process of Dundrannanization.
There’s a word for you! I made
it this morning, and it pleased me! I should like to
have suggested it to old Jonathan Frost himself.
Don’t think it too formidable for what it represents.
Not, of course, that the process will ever be complete
with Waldo; there will remain a stratum of Christian
weakness which it will not reach. But it may
go far with him; the Frost (forgive me, Julius!)
may be inches deep over his nature!  And I am
quite convinced that I have acquired a daughter, but
not quite sure that I haven’t lost a son. No, not
lost; half lost, perhaps. Briarmount overpowers
Cragsfoot: I suppose it was bound to be so; of course
it was; Aunt Bertha says so. She is an admirable
herald of the coming day. He loves me no less,
thank God; but the control of him has passed into
other hands. He is, quite dignifiedly, henpecked;
his admiration for her stops only short of idolatry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
I don’t know that it ought to stop much sooner, for
she is a notable girl. I’m very fond of her; if I
ever saw her burst into tears, or have hysterics, or
do anything really weak and silly, I believe I should
love her even more.”</p>

<p>Quite so. It was what might have been expected.
And Sir Paget’s assessment of his daughter-in-law
was precisely in accord with all that he had had the
opportunity of observing in that young woman.
That she could burst into tears, could have something
very like hysterics, could behave in a way that
might be termed weak and silly, was a piece of
knowledge confined, as I believed, to three persons
besides herself. She thought it was confined to two.
She had married one of them; did he think of it,
did he remember? As for the other&mdash;it has been
seen how she felt about the other. I was glad that
she did not know about the third; if I could help
it, she never should. I did not believe that she
would forgive my knowledge any more than she forgave
Lucinda’s. I don’t blame her; such knowledge
about oneself is not easy to pardon.</p>

<p>There was a postscript to Sir Paget’s letter. “By
the way, Mrs. Knyvett is dead&mdash;a month ago, at
Torquay. Aunt Bertha saw it in the <i>Times</i>. An
insignificant woman; but by virtue of the late Knyvett,
or by some freak of nature, she endowed the
world with a beautiful creature. Hallo, high
treason, Julius! But somehow I think that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
won’t hang me for it. I hope that poor child is not
paying too dearly for her folly.”</p>

<p>I remember that, when I had read the postscript,
I exclaimed, “Thank God!” Not of course, because
Mrs. Knyvett had died a month before at Torquay;
the event was not such as to wring exclamations from
one. It was the last few words that evoked mine.
Lucinda had a friend more in the world than she
knew. If I ever met her again, I would tell her.
She had loved Sir Paget. If his heart still yearned
ever so little after her, if her face ever came before
his eyes, it would, I thought, be something to her.
The words brought her face back before my eyes,
whence time and preoccupation had banished it.
Did the face ever&mdash;at rare moments&mdash;appear to
Waldo? Probably not. He would be too much
Dundrannanized!</p>

<p>The process for which Sir Paget’s reluctant
amusement found a nickname was a natural one in
the circumstances of the case. If the Dundrannan
personality was potent, so was the Dundrannan
property. Cragsfoot was a small affair compared
even to Briarmount alone; Waldo was not yet master
even of Cragsfoot, for Sir Paget was not the man
to take off his clothes before bedtime. Besides
Briarmount, there was Dundrannan Castle, with its
deer and its fishing; there was the Villa San Carlo
at Mentone; never mind what else there was, even
after “public objects” and Captain Frost had, between
them, shorn off so large a part of the Frost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
concerns and millions. Moreover, another process
set in, and was highly developed by the time I returned
to England in the autumn of 1918, when my
last foreign excursion on Government service ended.
Family solidarity, and an identity of business interests
in many matters, brought Nina, and, by consequence,
Waldo, into close and ever closer association
with Godfrey Frost. The young man was not
swallowed; he had too strong a brain and will of his
own for that; but he was attached. The three of
them came to form a triumvirate for dealing with
the Frost concerns, settling the policy of the Frost
family, defining the Frost attitude towards the world
outside. And everybody else was outside of that
inner circle, even though we of Cragsfoot might be
only just outside. So as Waldo, on his marriage,
had shifted his bodily presence from Cragsfoot to
Briarmount, his mind and his predominant interests
also centered there; and presently to his were added,
in great measure, Godfrey Frost’s. Nina presided
over this union of hearts and forces with a sure
tact; she did not seek to play the despot, but she
was the bond and the inspiration.</p>

<p>Naturally, then, if the three saw eye to eye in all
these great matters, they also saw eye to eye, and
felt heart to heart, on such a merely sentimental
subject as the view to take of Lucinda&mdash;of whom, of
course, Godfrey derived any idea that he had mainly
from Nina. Probably the idea thus derived was
that she was emphatically a person of whom the less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
said the better! Only&mdash;the curious fact crops up
again&mdash;she was not one of whom Nina was capable
of saying absolutely nothing, of giving no hints.
Her husband excepted, anybody really near to her
was sure to hear something of Lucinda. Besides,
there was the information, sketchy indeed, but significant,
which he had received from Aunt Bertha,
and perhaps that had made him question his cousin;
then either her answers or even her reluctance to
answer would have been enlightening to a man of
his intelligence.</p>

<p>He got home some time in October, and at his
request I went to see him in London, while he was
convalescent from that malaria which so seriously
impeded Reconstruction. From him I heard the
family plans. They were all three going shortly to
Nina’s villa at Mentone for the winter. For the
really rich it seemed that “the difficulties of the
times” presented no difficulty at all; a big motor
car was to take the party across France to their
destination.</p>

<p>“You see, we’re largely interested in works near
Marseilles, and I’m going out to have a look at
them; Waldo’s got doctor’s orders, Nina goes to
nurse him&mdash;and the kid can’t be left, of course. All
quite simple. Why don’t you come too?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I will&mdash;if I’m asked and can get a holiday.
It sounds rather jolly.”</p>

<p>“Top-hole! Besides, the war’s going to end.
Nina’ll ask you all right; and, as for a holiday, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
can’t do much at your game till the tonnage is released,
can you?”</p>

<p>He seemed about right there; on such questions
he had a habit of being right. At the back of my
mind, however, I was just faintly reluctant about
embracing the project, a little afraid of too thick a
Dundrannan atmosphere.</p>

<p>“Well, I must go to Cragsfoot first. After that
perhaps&mdash;if I am invited.”</p>

<p>“Jolly old place, Cragsfoot!” he observed. “I
don’t wonder you like to go there&mdash;even apart from
your people. It’s unlucky that Nina’s taken against
it, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know she had.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. You’ll see that&mdash;when the time comes&mdash;I
hope it’s a long way off, of course&mdash;she won’t
live there.”</p>

<p>“Waldo’ll want to live there, I think.”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t. He’d want to now, if it fell in.
But by the time it does, he’ll have had his mind
altered.” He laughed good-humoredly.</p>

<p>I rather resented that, having a sentimental feeling
for Cragsfoot. But it would probably turn out
true, if Nina devoted her energies to bringing it
about.</p>

<p>“Regular old ‘country gentleman’ style of place&mdash;which
Briarmount isn’t. Sort of place I should like
myself. I suppose you’d take it on, if Waldo didn’t
mean to live there?”</p>

<p>“You look so far ahead,” I protested. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
idea’s quite new, I haven’t considered it. I’ve always
regarded it as a matter of course that Waldo
would succeed his father there&mdash;as the Rillingtons
have succeeded, son to father, for a good many
years.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, and I appreciate that feeling.
Don’t think I don’t. Still that sort of thing can’t
last forever, can it? Something breaks the line at
last.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” I admitted, rather sulkily. If
Waldo did not live at Cragsfoot, if I did not “take
it on,” I could not help perceiving that Godfrey had
fixed his eye&mdash;that far-seeing Frost eye&mdash;on our ancestral
residence. This was a further development
of the Dundrannan alliance, and not one to my taste.
Instinctively I stiffened against it. I felt angry with
Waldo, and irritated with Godfrey Frost&mdash;and with
Nina too. True, the idea of Cragsfoot’s falling to
me&mdash;without any harm having come to Waldo&mdash;was
not unpleasant. But everything was in Waldo’s
power, subject to Sir Paget’s life interest; I remembered
Sir Paget’s telling me that there had been no
resettlement of the property on Waldo’s marriage.
Could Waldo be trusted not to see with the Frost
eye and not to further the Frost ambitions?</p>

<p>“It seems queer,” Godfrey went on, smiling still
as he lit his cigarette, “but I believe that Nina’s dislike
of the place has something to do with that other
girl&mdash;Waldo’s old flame, you know. She once said
something about painful associations&mdash;of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Waldo wasn’t in the room&mdash;and I don’t see what
else she could refer to, do you? She’s a bit sensitive
about that old affair, isn’t she? Funny thing&mdash;nothing’s
too big for a really clever woman, but, by
Jove, nothing’s too small either!”</p>

<p>“Like our old friend the elephant and the pin that
we were told about in childhood?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Nina will hatch a big plan one minute,
and the next she’ll be measuring the length of the
feather on the scullery-maid’s hat.”</p>

<p>“Well, but&mdash;I mean&mdash;love affairs aren’t always
small things, are they?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no, perhaps not. But when it’s all over
like that!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is rather funny,” I thought it best to
admit.</p>

<p>Certainly it would be funny&mdash;a queer turn of
events&mdash;if things worked out as I suspected my
young friend Godfrey of planning; if Nina persuaded
Waldo that he did not want to live at Cragsfoot,
and Waldo transferred his old home to his new
cousin. And if Nina’s reason were that Cragsfoot
had “painful associations” for her! Because then,
ultimately, if one went right back to the beginning,
it would be not Nina, but that other girl, Waldo’s
old flame, who would eject the Rillington family
from its ancestral estate! It was impossible not to
stand somewhat aghast (big words about that girl
again!) at such a trick of fate.</p>

<p>“The fact is, I suppose,” he went on, “that she’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
been fond of Waldo longer than she can afford to
admit. Then the memory might rankle! And
Nina’s not over-fond of opposition at any time.
I’ve found that out. Oh, we’re the greatest pals,
as you know, but there’s no disguising that!” He
laughed indulgently. “Yes, that’s Nina. I often
think that I must choose a wife with a meek and
quiet spirit, Julius.”</p>

<p>“The Apostle says that it is woman’s ornament.”</p>

<p>“Nina certainly thinks that it’s other women’s.
Oh, must you go? Awfully kind of you to have
come. And, I say, think about Villa San Carlo! I
believe it’s a jolly place, and Nina’s having it fitted
up something gorgeous, she tells me.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it rather difficult to get the work done just
now?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not particularly. You see, we’ve an interest
in&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Damn it all!” I cried, “have you Frosts interests
in everything?”</p>

<p>Godfrey’s good humor was imperturbable. He
nodded at me, smiling. “I suppose it must strike
people like that sometimes. We do bob up rather,
don’t we? Sorry I mentioned it, old fellow. Only
you see&mdash;it does account for Nina’s being able to get
the furniture for Villa San Carlo, and consequently
for her being in a position to entertain you and me
there in the way to which we are accustomed&mdash;in my
case, recently!”</p>

<p>“Your apology is accepted, Godfrey&mdash;if I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
there! And I don’t seriously object to you Frosts
straddling the earth if you want to. Only I think
you might leave us Cragsfoot.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t get in your way for a minute, my dear
chap&mdash;really I wouldn’t. We might live there together,
perhaps. That’s an idea!” he laughed.</p>

<p>“With the wife of a meek and quiet spirit to look
after us!”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I’ve got to find her first.”</p>

<p>“Sir Paget is very well, thank you. There’s no
hurry.”</p>

<p>“But there’s never any harm in looking about.”</p>

<p>He came with me to the door, and bade me a
merry farewell. “You’ll get your invitation in a
few days. Mind you come. Perhaps we’ll find her
on the Riviera! It’s full of ladies of all sorts of
spirits, isn’t it? Mind you come, Julius.”</p>

<p>My little fit of irritation over what he represented
was not proof against his own cordiality and good
temper. I parted from him in a very friendly mood.
And, sure enough, in a few days I did get my invitation
to the Villa San Carlo at Mentone.</p>

<p>“If you’ve any difficulty about the journey,” wrote
Nina, “let us know, because we can pull a wire or
two, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Pull a wire or two!” I believe they control the
cords that hold the firmament of heaven in its place
above the earth!</p>

<p>Besides&mdash;so another current of my thoughts ran&mdash;if
wires had to be pulled, could not Ezekiel Coldston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
&amp; Co., Ltd., pull them for themselves? Did
the Frosts engross the earth? I had no intention of
letting Nina Dundrannan graciously provide me
with “facilities”; that is the term which we used to
employ in H. M.’s Government service.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">A SECRET VISIT</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">I STAYED longer at Cragsfoot than I had intended.
The old folk there seemed rather
lonely and moody; and, if the truth must be
told, not quite so fully in harmony with one another
as of yore. Aunt Bertha was ailing, showing at last
signs of age and feebleness; Sir Paget was suffering
from a reaction after his war-time anxieties and
activities. A latent opposition of feeling between
them occasionally cropped out on the surface. In
Sir Paget it showed itself in humorously expressed
fears that I too&mdash;“the only one of my family left”&mdash;should
be “swallowed” if I went to Mentone; but
Aunt Bertha met the humor peevishly: “What nonsense
you talk, Paget!” or “Really, one would think
that you regret Waldo’s marriage! At all events,
things might have been worse.” Words like these
last skirted forbidden places, and we steered the conversation
away. But the opposition was real; when
they were alone together, it was probably more open,
and therefore worse. I lingered on, with the idea
that my presence in the house softened and eased it.</p>

<p>Moreover, I must own to a feeling in myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
which seemed ridiculous and yet was obstinate&mdash;a reluctance
to go to Villa San Carlo. What was the
meaning, or the sense, of that? Was I afraid of
being “swallowed” there, of being drawn into the
Dundrannan orbit and thereafter circling helplessly
round the Dundrannan sun? No, it was not quite
that. I took leave to trust to an individuality, an
independence, in myself, though apparently Sir Paget
had his doubts about it. It was rather that going to
the Villa seemed a definite and open ranging of myself
on Nina’s side. But on her side in what, my
reason asked. There was no conflict; it was all
over; the battle had been fought and won&mdash;if indeed
there could be said to have been any battle at all,
where one side had declined victory and left the prize
at the mercy of the other. But here again, however
irrationally, the feeling persisted, and, when
challenged to show its justification, called to witness
the two combatants themselves. In the end it was
their words, their tones, hints of some vague foreboding
in themselves, which had infected my mind.</p>

<p>What in the end overcame my reluctance and
took me to Mentone? Not the attraction of the
Villa, nor the lure of a holiday and sunshine. It
was, unexpectedly and paradoxically&mdash;a letter from
Arsenio Valdez! Addressed to my club, it was forwarded
to me at Cragsfoot. After a silence of
more than four years, he resumed his acquaintance
with me in this missive; resumed it without the least
embarrassment and with a claim to the cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
privilege of old friendship,&mdash;that of borrowing
money, of course.</p>

<p>He had, it appeared, joined the Italian Army
rather late in the day. Whether he took the step
of his free will&mdash;having solved his difficulties as to
the proper side to champion in the war&mdash;or on compulsion,
he did not say, and I have never discovered;
I was ignorant of Italian legislation, and even of his
legal nationality. Perhaps he made no great figure
as a soldier, brave as Lucinda had declared him to
be; at any rate, before very long he was put on transport
work connected with the Italian troops serving
on the Western front, with his quarters at Genoa.
Even from this form of military service the Armistice
appeared now to have freed him. He was for
the present “out of a job,” he said, and he gave me
an address in Nice, to which I was to reply, enclosing
the fifty pounds with which he suggested that I
should accommodate him. “Number 21 hasn’t
been quite so good a friend to me lately; hence temporary
straits,” he wrote. I could imagine the
monkeyish look on his face. And that reference to
“Number 21” was as near as he approached to any
mention of his wife.</p>

<p>I arranged for him to get the money through my
bank, and wrote to him saying that possibly I should
be in the South of France shortly and that, if so, I
would look him up. More precise details of my
plans I did not give; it was no business of his with
whom I proposed to stay. A week later I set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
for Mentone&mdash;with, I suppose, treason in my heart;
for, during my sojourn at Villa San Carlo, I meant
to enter into communication with the enemy, if I
could; and I did not intend to ask Lady Dundrannan’s
permission.</p>

<p>It was just before Christmas that I reached Mentone&mdash;without
Frost facilities&mdash;and joined the Big
Three; that nickname developed a little later (and
was accepted by her ladyship with complaisant
smiles); I use it now for convenience. They were
established, of course, in the height of luxury; there
seemed no difficulty about getting anything; the
furniture had all come; they had two cars&mdash;one to
enable Godfrey to visit those works near Marseilles,
another to promote the convalescence of Waldo. I
gathered that another could be procured for me, if
I liked&mdash;on what particular false pretense I did not
inquire. I said that, what with trams, trains, and
legs, I could manage my own private excursions; it
was only when I accompanied them that dignity was
essential. Nina never objected to sly digs at her
grandeur; they were homage, though indirect.</p>

<p>Besides Godfrey and myself, the only guest in the
house was Lady Eunice Unthank, a small, fair girl
of about nineteen or twenty, younger sister of a
friend whom Nina had made at her “finishing”
school in Paris, and who had subsequently made what
is called a brilliant marriage, so brilliant that it reflected
added luster on Lady Eunice’s own aristocracy.
The latter was a pleasant, simple, unassuming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
little person, very fond of the baby (as babies
go, it was quite a nice one), obedient and adoring
to Nina, frankly delighted with the luxury in which
she found herself. I understood that her own
family was large and not rich. However, Godfrey
was rich enough for two. Yes, that was the idea
which at once suggested itself. Mr. Godfrey (he
had dropped his “Captain” by now) and Lady
Eunice Frost! The one thing Godfrey needed.
And a gentle, amenable Lady Eunice too, quite satisfying
the Apostle! That perhaps was what Lady
Dundrannan also desired, that her rule might not be
undermined; the far-seeing eye embraced the future.
Anybody vulgar enough might have said that Lady
Eunice was at Villa San Carlo “on appro.” What
Lady Dundrannan said was that it was a charity
to give the child a good time; she did not get much
fun at home. But I think that it was organized
charity&mdash;on business principles.</p>

<p>What the sultan who had the handkerchief to
throw thought about this possible recipient of it, it
was too soon to say. He was attentive and friendly,
but as yet showed no signs of sentiment, and made
no efforts after <i>solitude à deux</i>. We were all very
jolly together, and enjoyed ourselves famously; for
the first ten days or so I quite forgot that Arsenio’s
letter had had anything to do with bringing me to
Mentone! In fact, I had never before encountered
Nina in such an entirely benign and gracious mood;
her happiness in her husband and baby seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
spread its rays over all of us. In such a temper she
was very attractive; but it also signified that she was
well content. In fact, there was, just now, an air of
triumph about her good humor and her benevolence;
it seemed especially pronounced in some smiles which
she gave me as it were, aside, all to myself. What
was there about me to excite her triumph? It
could hardly be because I came to stay with her;
were we not now cousins, and privileged&mdash;or
doomed&mdash;to one another’s society all our lives?</p>

<p>“Well, this is a fine time, after all our labors,” I
said to Waldo one morning as we smoked our pipes
after early breakfast. “You look tons better already!”</p>

<p>He smoked on for a moment before he spoke.
“I’m a very happy man now,” he said, and smiled at
me. “I know you laugh a bit, old chap, at the way
Nina runs us all. I don’t mind that. By Jove,
look how well she does it! She’s a wonderful girl!”</p>

<p>“She is,” I agreed.</p>

<p>“After all, unless a man takes the position that
all men are cleverer than any woman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Which is absurd! Yes, Waldo?”</p>

<p>“He may admit that a particular woman is cleverer
than himself.”</p>

<p>“That seems logical.”</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s not only her cleverness. I’m
much fonder of her than I used to&mdash;than I was even
when I married her. Anything that there was&mdash;well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the least bit too decisive about her&mdash;has worn
off. She’s mellowed.”</p>

<p>“So have you,” I told him with a laugh.</p>

<p>“My real life seems now to begin with my marriage,”
he said soberly. It could scarcely be doubted
that he meant to convey to me that a certain
episode in the past had lost all its importance for
him. Was that the explanation of his wife’s air of
triumph? No doubt a sufficient one in itself, and
perhaps enough to account for her liking to share
her triumph with me. I had, after all, known her
in days when she was not triumphant. However
that might be, Waldo’s statement took my mind
back to things that had happened before his “real
life” began&mdash;and incidentally to Arsenio Valdez.
I decided to bring off my secret expedition, and on
the next day&mdash;there being nothing in particular on
foot at the Villa&mdash;I slipped away directly after <i>déjeuner</i>,
and caught a train to Nice.</p>

<p>It traveled slowly, but it got me there by two
o’clock, and I made my way towards the address
which Arsenio had given me. I need hardly add
that this was a furtive and secret proceeding on my
part. I relied on not being questioned about him,
just as I had relied&mdash;and successfully&mdash;on not being
questioned about Lucinda at Cragsfoot.</p>

<p>I had a little difficulty in finding my way. The
house was in a back street, reached by several turns,
and not everybody I asked knew where it was. But
I found it; it was a <i>pâtisserie</i> of a humble order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Apparently the shop entrance was the only one, so
I went in by that, and asked if Monsieur Valdez
lodged there. A pleasant, voluble woman was
serving at the counter, and she told me that such
was the case. Monsieur Valdez had a room on the
second floor and was at home. He had not been
out that day; he had not been out for <i>déjeuner</i> yet,
late as it was. But there, Monsieur had employment
which kept him up at nights; he often slept
far into the day; it was indeed highly possible that
I might find him still in bed.</p>

<p>Was it? And she had spoken of “a room.” I
thought it judicious to obtain one more bit of information
before I mounted to the room on the
second floor.</p>

<p>“And&mdash;er&mdash;he’s sure to be alone, is he?”</p>

<p>She shook her head at me, her bright black eyes
twinkling in an affectation of rebuke.</p>

<p>“Monsieur need not disturb himself. Monsieur
Valdez is not married, and for the rest&mdash;in my
house! <i>Mais non, Monsieur!</i>”</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons, Madame,” said I, as I prepared
to mount the stairs, which rose from the back
of the shop.</p>

<p>“My husband is most scrupulous about my dignity,”
she cried to me in a tone of great pride, as I
ascended the first steps.</p>

<p>So that explained that; and I went upstairs.</p>

<p>There were only two rooms on the second floor&mdash;one
to the front, the other to the back of the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
The door of the former was open; it was a bedroom
with an obviously “double” appearance. I turned
to the latter and tried the door. It opened. I
walked in and closed the door softly behind me.</p>

<p>It was a small room, plainly but tidily furnished,
and well lighted by a big window above the bed in
which Arsenio lay. He was sleeping quietly. I
stood by the door, watching him, for quite a long
while. He was not greatly changed by the years
and whatever experiences he had passed through;
his face was hardened rather than coarsened, its lines
not obliterated by any grossness of the flesh, but
more sharply chiseled. A fallen spirit perhaps,
but with the spiritual in him still. His devilry, his
malice, would still have the redeeming savor of perception
and humor; he might yet be responsive to a
picturesque appeal, capable of a <i>beau geste</i>, even
perhaps, on occasion, of a true vision of himself; but
still also undoubtedly prone to those tricks which
had earned for him in days of old his nickname of
Monkey Valdez.</p>

<p>It was time to rouse him. I advanced towards
the bed, took hold of a chair that stood by it, sat
down, and forced a cough. He awoke directly, saw
me, apparently without surprise, and sat up in bed.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s you, Julius! You’ve turned up, as you
said you might. But you’ve not come for your fifty
pounds, I hope? My surroundings hardly suggest
any success there, do they? What time is it? I’ve&mdash;shall
we say lost?&mdash;my watch. Never mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
And I’m not going to ask you for another loan&mdash;oh,
well, only a fiver perhaps&mdash;because I’m expecting
a remittance any hour.” He looked up at the
window. “Ah, I perceive that the day is advanced.
I’ll get up. Don’t suppose that I can’t get up!
I’ve got two good suits&mdash;one for the day, and one
for the night; it’s a bad workman who pawns his
tools! You smoke while I dress, and we’ll have a
talk.”</p>

<p>He jumped lightly out of bed and proceeded to
make his toilet, questioning me briskly the while
about the state of affairs in England and what had
happened to me since our last meeting; he did not
refer to any of our common acquaintances. I observed
with some surprise that, when the time for it
came, the neatly folded suit which he took out of
his chest of drawers was evening dress. It was only
a little past three in the afternoon. He cast a
mocking glance at me.</p>

<p>“In enforced intervals,” he explained, “I pursue
an avocation that demands the garb of ceremony
from five o’clock in the day onwards till&mdash;well, till
it’s day again sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Intervals between what?”</p>

<p>“Between seasons of plenty.” He was now in
trousers and vest. He looked at his chin in the
glass. “Oh, but I must shave! Excuse me a moment.”</p>

<p>He ran out of the room, and was back in a
minute or two with a jug of steaming water. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
he stropped his razor, he went on, as though there
had been no interruption: “But on the whole I have
much to be thankful for. Brains will tell even&mdash;or
indeed especially&mdash;in a stupid world. Now tell me
what you’re doing on this pleasant coast. Oh, I
know you came to see me&mdash;partly. I’m grateful.
But&mdash;for example&mdash;you’re not staying with me.
Where are you staying?”</p>

<p>“At Mentone. With some old friends of ours.”</p>

<p>“Ah, and who may they be?” he asked, as he
scraped his chin.</p>

<p>“Lady Dundrannan&mdash;as she now is&mdash;and her
husband.”</p>

<p>He stopped shaving for a moment and turned
round to me, one side of his face scraped clean, the
other still covered with lathered soap. “Oh, are
they here? At Mentone?”</p>

<p>“They’ve got a villa there&mdash;Villa San Carlo. We
live in great state.”</p>

<p>“I won’t ask you to forsake them then, and share
my quarters. I take an interest in that household;
in fact, I feel partly responsible for it. I hope it’s
a success?” He grinned at me, as he sponged and
then toweled his face.</p>

<p>“A very brilliant success,” I assured him with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“That arrangement was always my idea of what
ought to happen&mdash;adjoining estates, the old blood
mingling with the new. So very suitable! That
process has been the salvation of the British aristocracy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
hasn’t it? So I&mdash;er&mdash;felt less scruple in
interfering with a less ideal arrangement.”</p>

<p>Here was a chance for him to refer to his wife.
He did not avail himself of it. I did not wish to be
the one to introduce that subject; if I showed curiosity,
he might turn mischievous and put me off
with a gibe or a lie.</p>

<p>He had finished his dressing by putting on a
dinner jacket. He sat down on the bed&mdash;I still
occupied the only chair in the room&mdash;and lit a
cigarette.</p>

<p>“Did you mention at Villa&mdash;Villa what did you
say it was?”</p>

<p>“San Carlo.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course! Did you mention at Villa San
Carlo that you were coming to see me?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. It’s about the last thing I should
think of mentioning there,” I said.</p>

<p>“Quite right. Better not!” he said with an approving
nod and, I fancied, an air of relief. “An
awkward topic! And a meeting would be more
awkward still. I must avoid Mentone, I think&mdash;at
all events, the fashionable quarter of it!”</p>

<p>At this moment the woman whom I had talked to
in the shop knocked at the door, opened it, and
ushered in another woman&mdash;the bearer of a registered
letter. “Aha!” cried Arsenio joyfully, as he
took it, hastily signed the receipt, and tore the envelope
open. Then he called his landlady back just
as she was closing the door: “Pray, Madame, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the kindness to send word to my&mdash;er&mdash;office that
indisposition will prevent my attendance this evening.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Monsieur, for shame!” said she, with the
same indulgent affectation of reproof as that which
she had bestowed on me.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen of means don’t go to offices,” he said,
waving his envelope. With a smile and a shrug
Madame left us.</p>

<p>“Now, Julius, if you’re returning to Villa&mdash;Villa&mdash;?&mdash;yes,
San Carlo!&mdash;this afternoon, I’ll do myself
the pleasure of accompanying you as far as
Monte Carlo. That will enable me to see more of
you, my friend, and&mdash;who knows but that Number
21 may be kind to me to-night?”</p>

<p>“Monte Carlo is very near Mentone,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“True, true! But delicacy of feeling, however
desirable and praiseworthy, must not interfere with
the serious business of life. We must take our
chance, Julius. If any unlucky meeting should occur,
I authorize and indeed implore you to cut me
dead! They will cut me, I shall cut them, I shall
cut you, you will cut me! We shall all cut, and all
be cut! And no harm will be done, no blood shed.
<i>Voilà</i>, Julius! See how, as they say in French, at
the very worst the thing will arrange itself!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">AN INTRODUCTION</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">ARSENIO VALDEZ was in the highest of
spirits that evening&mdash;the effect of the registered
letter, no doubt! His fun and
gayety brought back, or even bettered, the boy that
he had been at Cragsfoot; and he assumed a greater,
a more easy, intimacy with me: we had been boy to
man then; we were both men now. He was very
friendly; whatever his feelings might be about encountering
my kindred, evidently he found nothing
awkward in meeting me. As we walked up from
the station at Monte Carlo, he put his arm in mine
and said, “You must dine with me to-night. Yes,
yes, it’s no good shaking your head.” He smiled
as he added, “You may just as well dine with me as
with Lady Dundrannan. But if you feel any
scruples, you may consider the dinner as taken out
of your fifty, you know!”</p>

<p>It was a polite way of telling me that I had seen
the last of my fifty.</p>

<p>“I didn’t send that money altogether for you
alone,” I ventured to observe.</p>

<p>He looked at me. “You remind me, Julius!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Let me do it before we dine, or I might forget.
Half of this little windfall that I have had goes to
Lucinda. Half of it! Ah! there’s a post office.
Wait for me, I won’t be a minute.” And he darted
into the place. When he rejoined me, he wore an
air of great self-satisfaction. “Now I shall enjoy
my evening,” he said; “and all the more when I
think of what I should otherwise have been doing.”</p>

<p>“And what’s that?” I asked; the question did not
seem impertinent in view of his own introduction of
the subject.</p>

<p>“Do you ever frequent what are pharisaically
known as ‘hells’? For my part, I should sooner
call them ‘heavens.’ If you do, you’ll remember a
little bureau, or sometimes just a table, under the
care of a civil official, by whose kind help you change
notes that you had not meant to change, and cash
checks that you had never expected to have to write?
My suave and distinguished manners, together with
my mastery of several languages, enable me to perform
my functions in an ideal way&mdash;so much so
that even an occasional indisposition, such as overtook
me this evening, is sure to be benevolently
overlooked. Yes, I’m a cashier in a gambling den,
Julius.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m hanged!” said I, as we entered the
<i>Café de Paris</i>.</p>

<p>We sat down, and Arsenio ordered the best dinner
that was to be had. This done, he proceeded:
“You see, I’m a man who prizes his independence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
In that I resemble Lucinda; it’s one of our points of
union. She insists on pursuing her own occupation,
and accepts an occasional present from me&mdash;such as
I’ve just had the pleasure of sending her&mdash;only
under protest. When I’m in funds, I insist. So
with me. I also like to have my own occupation; it
gives me the sense of independence that I like.”</p>

<p>“But occasionally you have recourse to&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>His eyes sparkled at me over his glass of wine.
“My dear Julius, an occasional deviation from one’s
ruling principle&mdash;what is it? To err is human, to
forgive divine. And since you’ve forgiven me that
fifty, I shall be positively hurt if you don’t make an
excellent dinner!”</p>

<p>“It’s difficult to over value the privilege of being
your guest,” I observed rather grimly.</p>

<p>He laughed, and went on with his merry chatter.
I tried to take stock of him, as I listened and threw
in a remark here and there. Was he trying to deceive
himself with his talk of independence, or was
he merely trying to deceive me? Or was it that he
did not really care a straw about deceiving either of
us? He might like to puzzle me; that would be in
his monkey vein. Evidently he had given none of
my fifty pounds to Lucinda. Had he really sent her
anything when he went into the post office this evening?
And, if anything, what proportion of his
“windfall”? As much as half? Did Lucinda take
money from him&mdash;under protest? Or did she never
get the chance? And did she give him money?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
If his object were to puzzle me&mdash;he did it! But I
believed what he told me about his occupation; there
was the evidence of his dress suit, and of Madame’s
playful rebuke. Besides, it was in character with
him. When he lacked the wherewithal to play himself,
he would be where others played. At least he
got the atmosphere. Perhaps, too, his suave manners
and linguistic services were worth the price of a
stake to him now and then.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he went on, with a laugh, after describing
one or two odd shifts to which he had been put,
“the war may have paid my dear adopted country all
right&mdash;<i>sacro egoismo</i>, you know, Julius!&mdash;but it
played the devil with me. Zeppelins and ‘planes
over Venice! All the tenants bolted from my
<i>palazzo</i>, and forgot to leave the rent behind them.
Up to now they’ve not come back. Hence this temporary
fall in my fortunes. But it’ll all come right.”</p>

<p>“It won’t, if you go on gambling with any money
that you happen to get hold of.”</p>

<p>He became serious; at least, I think so. At all
events, he looked serious.</p>

<p>“Julius, I have no more doubt about it than I have
about the fact that I sit here, on this chair, in this
restaurant. Some day&mdash;some day soon&mdash;I shall
bring off a great <i>coup</i>, a really great <i>coup</i>. That
will reëstablish me. And then I shall have done
with it.” The odd creature’s face took on a rapt,
an almost inspired look. “And that <i>coup</i> will be
made, not at <i>trente-et-quarante</i>, not at baccarat, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
at good old roulette, and by backing Number 21.
It happened once before&mdash;you know when. Well,
it’ll happen again, my friend, and happen even bigger.
Then I shall resume my proper position; I
shall be able to give Lucinda her proper position.
Our happy days will come again.” His voice, always
a melodious one, fell to a soft, caressing note:
“We haven’t lost our love for one another. It’s
only that things have been difficult. But the change
will come!” His voice rose and grew eager again.
“It nearly came with your fifty. It was coming. I
actually saw it coming. But a fellow with a damned
ugly squint came and backed my play, the devil
take him! Oh, you may smile, but I know a <i>jettatore</i>
when I see one! Of course every blessed penny
went!”</p>

<p>“Yes, here he was sincere. It was perhaps his one
sincerity, his only faith. Or could the love he spoke
of&mdash;his love for his wife&mdash;also be taken as sincere?
Possibly, but there I felt small patience with him.
As to his faith in his gambler’s star, that was in its
way pathetic. Besides, are not we all of us prone to
be somehow infected by a faith like that, however
ridiculous our reason tells us that it is?</p>

<p>“That’s a rum idea of yours about Number 21,”
I said (I apologize for saying it thoughtfully!);
“you somehow associate it with&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“There’s really no need of your diplomacy,” he
mocked me. “What I didn’t tell you about it, Lucinda
did. Number 21 won me Lucinda.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
paused, gave a pull to his cigarette&mdash;we had by now
begun smoking&mdash;and added, “Won me Lucinda
back, I mean. But you know, I think, all about us.”</p>

<p>“And you know, it seems, about my meeting with
her&mdash;it must be nearly three years ago. I mean&mdash;at
Ste. Maxime?”</p>

<p>“She told me about it. She had been so delighted
to see you. You made great friends, you and she?
Well, she always liked you. I think you liked
her. In fact”&mdash;he smoked, he sipped his coffee,
then his cognac&mdash;“in fact, I’ve always wondered
why you chose to consider yourself out of the running
that summer at Cragsfoot long ago. You
chose to play the fogy, and leave Waldo and me to
do battle.”</p>

<p>“She was a child, and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As for a child&mdash;well, I found her more than
that. So did Waldo. As for your venerable years&mdash;a
girl is apt to take a man’s age at his own reckoning.
Short of a Methuselah, that is. Well, if
you ever had a chance&mdash;I think you had&mdash;you’ve lost
it. You’ll never get her now, Julius!”</p>

<p>“How much more damned nonsense are you going
to talk to-night, you&mdash;you Monkey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I’m still Monkey Valdez, aren’t I?
The Monkey that stole the fruit! But I got it, and
I shall keep it. After what she’s done for me,
could I ever distrust her?” His voice sounded as
it had when he spoke of Number 21.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“I certainly think that you’ve tried her pretty
high already,” I remarked dryly.</p>

<p>“And you’re very angry with me about it?”</p>

<p>“What would be the good? Only I wish the
devil you’d pull yourself together now.”</p>

<p>“Remember Number 21!” And now his voice
sounded as it had when he spoke of Lucinda!</p>

<p>“Where is she now, Arsenio? Still at Ste.
Maxime?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t possibly tell you where she is without
her permission.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stuff! If you think that she and I are such
friends&mdash;I hope we are&mdash;surely&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that she would care to receive
visits from a member of Lady Dundrannan’s house
party.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, I forgot that!”</p>

<p>“And I certainly wouldn’t take the responsibility
of concealing that fact about you&mdash;with the chance
of her discovering it afterwards. As for you,
wouldn’t you get into hot water with both ladies, if
your duplicity happened to be discovered? As regards
one another, aren’t they a trifle sensitive?”
He leaned back in his chair, with an air of amusement
at the situation which he had suggested. “Even
your little visit to me you thought it judicious to
make on the quiet,” he reminded me with a chuckle.</p>

<p>I sat silent; if the truth must be told, I was rather
abashed. On reflection&mdash;and on a reflection
prompted by Monkey Valdez!&mdash;what I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
proposing to do seemed not quite the square thing.
Anyhow, a doubtful case; it is a good working rule
not to do things that you would not like to be found
out in.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I oughtn’t to have come to see
you either?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t matter so much. Nina has no animosity
against me.” His eyes twinkled. “Still,
don’t mention it, there’s a good fellow. You see,
she’d question you, and I am rather down on my
luck. Lucinda and I both are. I daresay you’ll
understand that we shouldn’t care for that to get
round through Nina to Waldo?”</p>

<p>That feeling seemed natural and intelligible
enough. The contrast between splendor and&mdash;well&mdash;something
like squalor&mdash;in view of the past they
would hardly wish Lady Dundrannan and her husband
to be in a position to draw it.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, what’s done’s done; but you and I had
perhaps better not meet any more just for the
present.”</p>

<p>“I’ve roused your scruples?” he laughed. “I, the
moralist! Just as you like, old fellow. I’m glad
you happened to hit on a lucky night&mdash;hope you’ve
enjoyed the dinner?”</p>

<p>“Immensely, thanks. But I’d better be getting
back now, I think.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s about time I got to business.” He
jerked his thumb in the direction of the Casino.
“Let me pay, and we’ll be off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>In another five minutes we should have parted
company, and my indiscretion in visiting Arsenio
Valdez from Villa San Carlo would have had no
consequences. But things were not fated to end that
way. While my host was paying the bill&mdash;he put
down very openly, perhaps with some slight flourish,
a note for five hundred francs&mdash;I felt a hand laid on
my shoulder. I looked up, and saw Godfrey Frost.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said he, with a laugh, “you’re not the only
truant! I got a little bored myself, and thought I’d
run over here and have a flutter. We’ll go back
together, shall we? May I sit down at your table?
I’m late, but they say they can give me something
cold.”</p>

<p>Arsenio’s eyes were upon me; with his infernal
quickness the fellow must have detected an embarrassment
on my face; his own puckered into a
malicious smile. He settled back into the chair
which he had been about to vacate&mdash;and waited.</p>

<p>What could I do? With fate and Monkey Valdez
both against me? He divined that for some
reason I did not want to introduce him. Therefore
I must be made to! Godfrey also waited&mdash;quite
innocently, of course, just expecting the proper, the
obvious thing. I had to do it; but, with a faint hope
that they might not identify one another, I said
merely, “Sit down, of course. Mr. Frost&mdash;my
friend, Mr. Valdez.”</p>

<p>The Monkey twisted his face; I believe that he
was really vexed. (Had not Lucinda said that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
had taken against all things English?) “I’m not
<i>Mr.</i> Valdez, Julius. I’m Monsieur Valdez, if you
like, or, more properly, Don Arsenio Valdez.”</p>

<p>“Delighted to meet you, Don Arsenio,” said
young Frost, composedly taking his seat. “I think
I’ve heard of you from my cousin, Lady Dundrannan.”</p>

<p>“An old acquaintanceship,” said the Monkey.
“One of the many that, alas, the war interrupted!
I hope that your cousin is well?”</p>

<p>“First class, thank you,” answered Godfrey.
“Ah, here’s my cold chicken!”</p>

<p>With the arrival of the stranger Arsenio had assumed
his best manner, his most distinguished air;
he could do the high style very well when he chose,
and if his dress suit was a trifle shabby, there was
always the war to account for a trifle like that. He
was evidently bent on making a favorable impression.
The talk turned on the tables, where Godfrey
had been trying his luck with some success. But
Arsenio was no longer the crazy gambler with a
strange hallucination about Number 21; he was a
clear-sighted, cool-minded gentleman who, knowing
that the odds against him must tell in the end, still
from time to time risked a few louis for his pleasure.</p>

<p>“After all, it’s one of the best forms of relaxation
I know. Just enough excitement and not too much.”</p>

<p>“I never play for more than I can afford to lose,”
said Godfrey. “But I must confess that I get pretty
excited all the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“It can’t make much difference to you what you
lose,” I growled. This meeting, for which I felt
responsible, somehow put me out of temper. What
was the Monkey up to? He was so anxious to
make a good impression!</p>

<p>“It would be affectation to pretend not to know
that you can afford to treat the freaks of fortune
with composure,” he said to Godfrey with a smile.</p>

<p>Godfrey looked pleased. He was still fresh to
his position and his money; he enjoyed the prestige;
he liked to have the Frost greatness admired, just
as his cousin Nina did.</p>

<p>“When I played more than I do now,” Arsenio
pursued, “I used to play a system. I don’t really
believe in any of them, but I should like to show it to
you. It might interest you&mdash;though I’ve come
now to prefer a long shot&mdash;a bold gamble&mdash;win or
lose&mdash;and there’s an end of it! Still my old system
might&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I got up. I had had enough of this&mdash;whatever
Arsenio’s game might be. “It’s time we were getting
back,” I said to Godfrey. “Have you your car
here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll go. But look here, Don Arsenio,
I should like to hear about your system. If you’re
free, lunch with me here to-morrow, and afterwards
we’ll drop in and try it&mdash;in a small way, just for fun,
you know.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow? Yes, I shall be delighted. About
half-past twelve? Shall I see you, too, Julius?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; systems bore me to death,” I said gruffly.
“Besides, those Forrester people are coming to lunch
at the Villa to-morrow, Godfrey.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason for being out!” laughed
Godfrey. “We’ll meet, then, Don Arsenio,
whether this old chap comes or not. That’s
agreed?”</p>

<p>Arsenio assented. We left him outside the <i>café</i>,
waving his hand to us as the car started. At the
last moment he darted one of his mischievous
glances at me. At least, he was thoroughly enjoying
the situation; at most&mdash;well, at most he might be up
to almost anything. He had told us that he did not,
after all, feel like playing that night, since we had to
leave him; he would go straight home, he said.
That probably meant that he was saving up his
money for something!</p>

<p>Godfrey was silent on the way home, and did not
refer to Arsenio till we found ourselves in the
smoking room at the Villa: we had it to ourselves;
the others had gone to bed.</p>

<p>“I was interested to meet that fellow,” he then
remarked. “Where did you run into him?”</p>

<p>I told him of my visit. “For the sake of old times
I just wanted to see how he was getting on,” I added
apologetically. “But I doubt whether I did right,
and I don’t mean to see any more of him at present.”</p>

<p>“Why do you doubt whether you did right?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m Nina’s guest just now; frankly, I
don’t think she’d like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s no reason to tell, is there?”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, I didn’t mean to tell her.
But you turned up!”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Oh, I won’t tell her either.
We’ll keep it dark, old fellow.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve arranged to meet him at lunch again
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Nina will be lunching here&mdash;with the Forresters,
so that will be all right, though it’s a doubtful
point whether affording us bed and board gives Nina
a right of control over the company we keep outside
the house.”</p>

<p>“I just had a feeling&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, perhaps you’re right.” He was
standing before the fire, smoking a cigar; he seemed
to ponder the little question of morals, or etiquette,
for a moment. Then he smiled. “So that’s the
dashing lover who cut out poor Waldo and ran
away with the famous Lucinda, is it? But where’s
the lady, Julius?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any idea. She wasn’t at the place
where I found him to-day. Why do you want to
know where she is?”</p>

<p>I suppose that my tone was irritable. He raised
his brows, smiling still. “Don’t you think that a
little curiosity is natural? She is, after all, an important
figure in the family history. And she is,
so far as I’m aware, the only woman who’s ever got
the better of Nina. I should like to see her.” He
paused a moment, his lips set in the firm and resolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
smile with which I was familiar on Lady Dundrannan’s
lips&mdash;the Frost smile. “Yes, I should
certainly like to see her. And I’m not really much
interested in roulette systems. That for your information,
Julius!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">FOR AULD LANG SYNE</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">I AWOKE the next morning with my head full of
Lucinda; the thought of her haunted me. My
desire to see her, to know how she fared, had
been constant since I came to Mentone; it had really
prompted my visit to Arsenio Valdez; it had made
me restless under the gilded hospitality of Villa San
Carlo&mdash;a contrast was always thrusting itself under
my eyes. But it was brought to a sharper point by
the events of the day before, by the mode of living in
which I had found Valdez, by his concealment of her
and reticence about her. I felt now simply unable
to go on faring sumptuously at Villa San Carlo
every day, while she was in all likelihood suffering
hardship or even want.</p>

<p>There was another strain of feeling, which developed
now, or came to the surface. As I drank
my morning coffee and smoked a cigar, my memory
traveled back through my acquaintance with her&mdash;back
through my intercourse with her at Ste.
Maxime, with all its revelation of her doings, feelings,
and personality; back through all that to the
first days at Cragsfoot which seemed now so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
ago, on the other side of the barrier which her flight
had raised and the war had made complete. It was
Arsenio who had set me on the line of thought. I
recalled my mood in those days, the state of mind
in which I had been, and saw how justly his quick
wits had then divined it and had yesterday described
it. I had chosen to play the fogy, to consider myself
out of the running. It was quite true. He had
paid me the compliment of saying that he did not
know why I should have done this. He did not
know. I do not think that I knew myself at the
time. We see our feelings most clearly when they
possess us no longer. The woman who had been
more than any one else in the world to me was still
alive in my heart in those days, and still mistress
of my thoughts, though she walked the earth no
longer and her voice was forever silent. It was
still seeming to me, as it does to a man in such
a case, that my story was told and finished, that
I was done. Beside the fresh young folk at Cragsfoot,
I might well feel myself a fogy. What could
Lucinda seem to me then but a charming child playing
with her fellows?</p>

<p>If Arsenio’s words set me thus smiling&mdash;even if
half in melancholy over a vanished image that rose
again from the past, and flitted transiently across
a stage that she had once filled&mdash;smiling at the memory
of how old&mdash;how “finished” for affairs of the
heart&mdash;I had once seemed to myself, there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
danger that they might make me forget how old
I was, in sad fact, at the present moment.</p>

<p>Towards this mistake another thing contributed.
Combativeness is usually a characteristic of youth;
Godfrey Frost had stirred it up in me. In spite
of the plea of “family history” which he had put
forward (with a distinct flavor of irony in his tone),
my feelings acknowledged no warrant for his claim
to a just curiosity and interest about Lucinda, and
resented the intimation, conveyed by that firm and
resolute Frost smile, that he intended to take a
hand in her affairs, on the pretext of studying a
roulette system under her husband’s tuition. Such
an attitude, such an intention, seemed somehow insulting
to her; if the Rillingtons had a right to treat
her with less respect than that which is due to any
lady&mdash;even if Nina based a right to do so on what
had happened in the past&mdash;Godfrey had none. If
she chose to remain hidden, what business was it
of his to drag her into the light? There seemed
something at least ungallant, unchivalrous in it. I
ought to have remembered that he had only the
general principles of chivalry to guide him, whereas
I had the knowledge of what Lucinda was, of her
reserve and delicate aloofness. In the end his curiosity
might find itself abashed, rebuked, transformed.
I did not think of that, and for the time
anger clouded my liking for him.</p>

<p>Coincidently there came over me a weariness, an
impatience, of Villa San Carlo. It was partly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Lady Dundrannan created&mdash;quite unintentionally,
of course&mdash;the atmosphere of a Court about her;
there was always the question of what would please
Her Majesty! This was amusing at first, but ended
by growing tedious. But, deeper than this, there
was the old conflict, the old competition. Some unknown
and dingy lodging, somewhere on the Riviera
coast, was matching its lure against all the
attractions of magnificent Villa San Carlo. That
was the end of it with me&mdash;and with Godfrey
Frost!</p>

<p>I sought out Nina before lunch in her boudoir, a
charming little room opening on the garden, with
Louis Quinze furniture on the floor and old French
Masters on the walls; really extremely elegant.</p>

<p>Her ladyship sat at her writing table (a “museum
piece,” no doubt), sorting her letters. She
was not looking her most amiable, I regretted to
observe, but, as soon as I came in, she spoke to me.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this too bad? Godfrey’s had to go over
to the works. Some trouble’s arisen; he doesn’t
even tell me what! He went off at ten o’clock,
before I was downstairs, merely leaving a note to
say he’d gone, and might not be back for two or
three days. He took his man and a portmanteau
with him in the car, Emile tells me. And to-morrow
is Eunice’s birthday, and he’d delighted the
child by promising to take us for a long drive and
give us lunch somewhere. It’s so seldom that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
puts himself out to give her pleasure, that I was&mdash;that
it seems a shame.”</p>

<p>“A disappointment, certainly, Nina.”</p>

<p>“It knocks the whole thing on the head. The
day would be too long for Waldo, and what would
she care about going with you and me? Oh, I beg
your pardon, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course!  Two’s company; four can move in
companies; but three’s hopeless!”</p>

<p>“I’m really vexed.” She looked it. “I wonder if
he’s really gone on business!”</p>

<p>“You could telephone the works and find out if
he’s there,” I suggested rather maliciously. To tell
the truth, I did not think that he would be&mdash;not
much there, at all events.</p>

<p>“My dear Julius, I’m not quite an idiot in dealing
with young men whom I want to&mdash;whose friendship
I like and value. Do you suppose he’d like
me telephoning after him as if I was his anxious
mother?”</p>

<p>A wise woman! But just at the moment she was
irritated, so that she had nearly put the relations
which she wished to maintain between herself and
Godfrey too bluntly. However, her amendment
was excellent.</p>

<p>“Well, there it is! I must explain it to poor
Eunice as well as I can. After all, you might take
her to Monte and let her have a little gamble. I’ll
give her a present. That’ll be better than nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, Nina! But&mdash;well, the fact is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you want to go off on your own, too?”
she asked rather sharply. “Well, I suppose it is
dull here. Waldo and I are too conjugal, and Eunice&mdash;well,
she’s a dear, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s not a bit dull here. It never could be where
you are” (I meant that), “and anyhow old Waldo
would be enough for me. And I’m not out for
sprees, if that’s what you mean. But&mdash;may I
smoke?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Don’t be silly!”</p>

<p>I began to smoke. She rose and came to the
fireplace, where she stood with her arm resting on
the mantelpiece, looking down at me, for I had sat
down on one of her priceless chairs; it seemed rather
a liberty, but I did it&mdash;a liberty with the chair, I
mean, not with its owner.</p>

<p>She was looking very vexed; she hated her
schemes to go awry. She had been kind to me; I
liked her; and she was one of us now&mdash;the wife of a
Rillington, though she bore another name. More
than ever it seemed that I ought to play fair with
her&mdash;for those reasons; also because it appeared
likely that she was not meeting with fair play elsewhere&mdash;at
all events, not with open dealing.</p>

<p>“I’m your guest,” I began, with some difficulty,
“and your&mdash;well, and all the rest of it. And I
want&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To do something that you think I mightn’t like
a guest and friend of mine to do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s it.” I gratefully accepted her quick assistance.
It was quick indeed, for the next instant
she added: “That means that you want to go and
see Lucinda Valdez? It’s the only thing you can
mean. What else is there which you could think
would matter to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I want to find out where she is,
what she’s doing, and whether she’s in distress. I
hope you won’t think that wrong, or unnatural, or&mdash;or
disloyal to Waldo or to you?”</p>

<p>I looked up at her as I spoke. To my surprise
her air of vexation, her thwarted air, gave place to
that sly, subtle look of triumph which I had marked
on her face before. She seemed to consider for a
moment before she answered me.</p>

<p>“Go, of course, if you like. I have no possible
claim to control your actions. I shan’t consider
that you’re doing anything unfriendly to Waldo,
much less to me&mdash;though I do think it would be
better not to mention it to Waldo. But if all you
want is to know where Lucinda is, and whether
she’s in distress, I’m in a position to save you
trouble by informing you on both those points.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you are!” I exclaimed. She had
really surprised me this time. She saw it; her lips
curved in a smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“She’s living with her husband at Nice, and,
whatever may have been the case before, she isn’t
at present in distress, because for the last two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
months or so&mdash;since soon after we came out&mdash;I have
had the privilege of supplying her wants.”</p>

<p>I nearly fell out of the priceless chair. I did
stare at her in sheer astonishment. Then the memory
flashed into my mind&mdash;Arsenio’s remittance, his
dinner at the <i>Café de Paris</i>, his remark that I might
just as well dine with him as with Lady Dundrannan.
It did come to much the same thing, apparently!</p>

<p>“I did it for Auld Lang Syne,” said Nina gently,
softly. Oh, so triumphantly!</p>

<p>Now I understood her sly, exultant glances at
me in the preceding days. She had always suspected
me of being on the enemy’s side, one of Lucinda’s
faction (it was small enough). What
would I have to think of Lucinda now? Nina had
been conceiving of herself as the generous benefactress
of a helpless and distressed Lucinda. A
grateful Lucinda, eating from her hand all but literally!
That was her revenge on the girl who had
cut her out with Waldo, on the girl who had seen
her sobbing on the cliff. It was not a bad one.</p>

<p>“One would not like to think of her being in want,
and so exposed to temptation,” Nina remarked reflectively.
“Because, of course, she is pretty; she
was, anyhow.”</p>

<p>I smiled at that&mdash;though I fancy that she meant
to make me angry.</p>

<p>“You must excuse me, Nina, but I don’t believe
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right!” She walked across to her desk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
unlocked a drawer, took out a letter, and brought
it back with her. She gave it to me. “Read that,
then, Julius.”</p>

<p>It was from Arsenio. I read it hastily, for it disgusted
me. It sent to Madame la Baronne (he
wrote in French) the grateful thanks of his wife
and himself for her most generous kindness, once
again renewed. In a short time he hoped to be independent;
might he for one week more trespass
on her munificence? It was not for himself; it was
simply to enable his wife to make a decent appearance,
until an improvement in her health, now, alas,
<i>very</i> indifferent, made it possible for her to seek
some suitable employment&mdash;&mdash;So far I read, and
handed the letter back to Nina; she would not take it.</p>

<p>“Keep it,” she said. “I’ve several more; he says
the same thing every week&mdash;oh, that about the ‘decent
appearance’ is new; it’s been rent and food before.
Otherwise it’s the same as usual.”</p>

<p>I looked at the date of the letter; it had been
written three days before.</p>

<p>“When did you last send him money?”</p>

<p>“The day before yesterday, if you want to know.”</p>

<p>Yes, I had dined on it. And Arsenio had sent
half of it to Lucinda; so he had told me, at least.
And the rest he was keeping, in order to show
Godfrey Frost the working of his system.</p>

<p>“I was with him when he got it.”</p>

<p>“You were with him? When? Where?” she
asked quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>I told of my afternoon with Monkey Valdez;
surely he had now doubly, trebly earned the name!
She listened with every sign of satisfaction and
amusement.</p>

<p>“You didn’t see his wife? She was out at her
work, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“He’s living in a single room. There was no sign
of her, and the&mdash;er&mdash;furniture did not suggest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Really, Julius, I’m not interested in their domestic
arrangements,” said Lady Dundrannan.
“And you left him at Monte Carlo?”</p>

<p>I assented; but I kept Godfrey’s secret. It was
not my affair to meddle in that; the more so inasmuch
as his meeting with Arsenio had not been his
fault at all, but my own. To give him away would
be unpardonable in me. Nor did I tell her that
Arsenio had at least professed to send half the
money to Lucinda; I was not convinced that he had
really done it; and&mdash;well, I thought that she was
triumphant enough already.</p>

<p>I folded Arsenio’s letter and put it in my pocket,
with no clear idea of what I meant to do with
it, but with just a feeling that it might give me a
useful hold on a slippery customer. Then I looked
up at Nina again; she had the gift of repose, of
standing or sitting still, without fidgets. She stood
quite still now; but her exultant smile had vanished;
her face was troubled and fretful again.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ve told you this in confidence,” she
said, without looking at me. “I’ve not bothered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Waldo with it, and I shan’t until he’s stronger, at
all events.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand. But I’m not in the least
convinced.”</p>

<p>Then she turned quickly towards me. “The letter
speaks for itself&mdash;or do you think I’ve
forged it?”</p>

<p>“The letter speaks for itself, and it convicts Arsenio
Valdez. But there’s nothing to show that Lucinda
knows where the money comes from. He
probably tells her that he earns it, or wins it, and
then lies to you about it.”</p>

<p>“Why should he lie to me about it?”</p>

<p>“He thinks that you’d be more likely to send it
for her than for him, I suppose. At any rate, I’m
convinced that she would rather starve than knowingly
take money from you.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>I retorted her own phrase on her. “Because of
Auld Lang Syne, Nina.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know much about that,” she remarked
sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, a good deal. Some you’ve told me yourself.
Some Lucinda has told me. I met her down
here&mdash;not at Mentone, but on the Riviera,&mdash;about
three years ago.”</p>

<p>“What was she doing then?”</p>

<p>“I can tell you nothing of that. She did not
wish you or the people at Cragsfoot to know.”</p>

<p>“I daresay not!” Then she went on, quietly but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
with a cold and scornful impatience. “What do
all you men find in the woman? You, Julius, won’t
believe the plainest evidence where she’s concerned.
Waldo won’t hear her name mentioned; he does
recognize the truth about her by now, of course&mdash;what
she really was&mdash;but still he looks as if I were
desecrating a grave if I make the most distant reference
to the time when he was engaged to her&mdash;and
really one can’t help occasionally referring to
old days! And now even Godfrey seems eaten up
with curiosity about her; he’s been trying to pump
me about her. I suppose he thinks I don’t see
through him, but I do, of course.”</p>

<p>“She’s an interesting woman, Nina. Don’t you
think so yourself?”</p>

<p>“How can she be interesting to Godfrey, anyhow?
He’s never seen her. Yet I shouldn’t be a
bit surprised if at this moment he’s hunting the
Riviera for her!”</p>

<p>How sharp she was, how sharp her resentful
jealousy made her!</p>

<p>“It’s as if you were all in a conspiracy to prevent
me from getting that woman out of my head! Well&mdash;you
don’t make any answer!”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“About what Godfrey’s doing.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about what he’s doing. There’s
what he said in the note he left for you.”</p>

<p>She gave an impatient shrug. “Oh, the note he
left for me! Why didn’t he tell me face to face?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
I suppose he could have waited half an hour!”</p>

<p>It was plain that Godfrey’s departure&mdash;sudden
and certainly unceremonious compared with the deference
which he had been (indeed, which all of
our party were) in the habit of showing towards
her&mdash;had upset her seriously. She showed me more
of her inner mind, of a secret uneasiness which
possessed her. It had been lulled to rest by that
picture of a helpless and grateful Lucinda; I had
shaken her faith in that, or at least my obstinate
skepticism had made her faith angry rather than
serene, eager to convince the skeptic and thereby
to confirm itself anew.</p>

<p>After a long pause she spoke again in a much
more composed fashion, and even smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, Julius, go and see; go and find her, and
find out the truth about it. That’ll be the best
thing. And you can come back and tell me. In
view of Arsenio Valdez’s letter I’m entitled to know
their real circumstances, anyhow. Into her secrets
I don’t want to pry, but I’ve sent them money on
the strength of his letters.”</p>

<p>“What I expect is to be able to tell you not to
send any more.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you expect that. But you’ll find
yourself wrong about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the ‘issue to be tried,’” I said with a
laugh, as I rose from my chair. I was glad to be
able to obey the impulse within me without quarreling
with Nina. I hoped to be able to carry the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
whole thing through&mdash;wherever it might lead&mdash;without
that.</p>

<p>“You’re off directly?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, not this minute. After lunch will be time
enough, I think.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t time enough for Godfrey,” she reminded
me quickly. But the next moment she
flushed a little, as though ashamed. “Oh, never
mind that! Let’s stick to business. What you’re
going to find out for me is whether Arsenio Valdez&mdash;yes,
Arsenio&mdash;is a proper object for charitable
assistance, whether he makes a proper use of what
I send him, and whether I ought to send more.”</p>

<p>“That, so far as you’re concerned, is it precisely.”</p>

<p>On which polite basis of transparent humbug
Nina and I parted for the moment. We were to
meet again at lunch. But Waldo would be there;
so no more of our forbidden subject.</p>

<p>Alas! here was to be the end of the subject altogether
for some little while. At lunch a very
crestfallen man, though he tried to wear an unconcerned
air, informed Lady Dundrannan that Sir
Ezekiel Coldston had wired him a peremptory summons
to attend an important business conference
in Paris; so there was an end of the Riviera too for
the time being. The order must be obeyed at once.
Waldo came into the room just as I achieved this
explanation; somehow it sounded like a confession
of defeat.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, the Riviera will wait till you come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
back,” said Her Ladyship, with an unmistakable
gleam of satisfaction in her eye.</p>

<p>She had tactfully agreed to the search for Lucinda,
but she had not liked it. It was at any rate
postponed now.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SYSTEM WORKS</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">I WAS in Paris for full four weeks, representing
Sir Ezekiel (who was laid up with asthma)
on the International Commercial Conference
on the Regulation and Augmentation of the World’s
Tonnage, a matter in which our company was, of
course, deeply interested. It was the best chance
I had yet secured of distinguishing myself in the
business world. The work, besides being important
and heavy, was also interesting. The waking intervals
between our sessions and conferences were
occupied by luncheons, banquets, and <i>conversaziones</i>;
if we dealt faithfully with one another at the business
meetings, we professed unlimited confidence in
one another on the social occasions. In fact, if
we had really believed all we said of one another
after lunch or after dinner, each of us would have
implored his neighbor to take all the goods, or tonnage,
or money that he possessed and dispose of
it as his unrivaled wisdom and unparalleled generosity
might dictate. We did not, however, make
any such suggestions in business hours; the fact that
we did quite the opposite prolonged the negotiations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>All of which brings me to the ungallant confession
that the two ladies, who had occupied so much
of an idle man’s thoughts at Mentone, occupied
considerably less of a busy man’s at Paris. They
were not forgotten, but they receded into the background
of my thoughts, emerging to the forefront
only in rare moments of leisure; even then my mental
attitude was one of greater detachment. I had
a cold fit about the situation, and some ungracious
reflections for both of them. Absence and preoccupation
blunted my imagination, even when they
did not entirely divert my thoughts. My mind was
localized; it did not travel far or for long outside
my daily business.</p>

<p>It was when our deliberations had almost reached
a conclusion, as the official report put it&mdash;when our
agreement had gone to the secretaries to be drafted
in proper form&mdash;that I got a telegram from Godfrey
Frost, telling me that he would be in Paris the
next day and asking me to dine with him. Putting
off some minor engagement which I had, I accepted
his invitation.</p>

<p>It was not till after dinner, when we were alone
in his sitting room at the hotel, that he opened to
me what he had to say. He did it in a methodical,
deliberate way. “I’ve something to say to you. Sit
down there, and light a cigar, Julius.”</p>

<p>I obeyed him. Evidently I was in for a story&mdash;of
what sort I did not know. But his mouth wore
its resolute look, not the smile with which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
chaffed me after our meeting with Arsenio Valdez
at Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>“The system worked,” he began abruptly.</p>

<p>“You won?” I asked, astonished.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to interrupt for a little while,
if you don’t mind. Of course, I didn’t win; I never
supposed I should. But the system worked. I found
Madame Valdez. Be quiet! After two nights of
the system, I politely&mdash;more or less politely&mdash;intimated
that I was sick of it; also that I didn’t see
my way to finance any further the peculiarly idiotic
game which he played on his own account, in the
intervals of superintending the system. The man’s
mad to think that he’s got a dog’s chance, playing
like that! He’d stayed with me in Monte those
two days. I said that I was afraid his wife would
never forgive me if I kept him from her any longer.
He said that, having for the moment lost <i>la veine</i>,
he was not in a position to return my hospitality;
otherwise he and his wife would have been delighted
to see me at Nice. Well, with the usual polite circumlocutions,
he conveyed to me that there was a
pleasant, quiet little hotel in Nice where he generally
stayed&mdash;when he was in funds, he meant, I
suppose&mdash;and that, although Madame Valdez was
not staying there at present, she might be prevailed
upon to join him there, and certainly we should
make a pleasant party. ‘I am <i>le bienvenu</i> at a very
cozy little place in Nice, if we want an hour’s distraction
in the evening. My wife goes to bed early.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
She’s a woman with her own profession, and it
takes her out early in the morning.’ So that seemed
all right, only&mdash;you can guess! I smoothed over
the difficulty. At that little hotel, at dinner on
the next Sunday, I, Valdez’s welcome guest, had
the privilege of being presented to Madame Valdez&mdash;or,
as he called her, Donna Lucinda.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the system worked, Godfrey,” I observed.</p>

<p>He did not rebuke my interruption, but he took
no heed of it. His own story held him in its grip,
whatever effect it might be having on his auditor.</p>

<p>“She came just as if she were an invited guest,
and rather a shy one at that; a timid handshake
for Valdez, a distant, shy bow for me. He greeted
her as he might have a girl he was courting, but
who would generally have nothing to do with him&mdash;who
had condescended just this once, you know.
Only she said to him&mdash;rather bashfully&mdash;‘Do you
like the frock I bought, Arsenio?’ It was a pretty
little frock&mdash;a brightish blue. Quite inexpensive
material, I should say, but very nicely put together;
and it suited her eyes and hair. What eyes and
hair she has, by Jove, Julius!”</p>

<p>He had told me not to interrupt; I didn’t.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me what she was like?” he
asked suddenly and rather fiercely.</p>

<p>“It was what you told me you meant to find out
for yourself, Godfrey.”</p>

<p>“Well, we sat there and had dinner. She seemed
to enjoy herself very much; made a good dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
you know, and seemed to accept his compliments&mdash;Valdez’s,
I mean&mdash;with a good deal of pleasure;
he was flowery. I didn’t say much. I was damned
dull, in fact. But she glanced at me out of the
corner of her eye now and then. Look here, Julius,
I’m an ass at telling about things!”</p>

<p>“I’ve known better <i>raconteurs</i>; but get on with
it, if you want to.”</p>

<p>“Want to? I must. As a matter of fact, I’ve
come to Paris just to tell you about it. And now
I can’t.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t exactly easy to describe, to&mdash;to give
the impression of. But remember&mdash;I know her.”</p>

<p>He had been walking up and down; he jerked
himself into a chair, and relit his cigar&mdash;it had
gone out. “I don’t much remember what we talked
about at first&mdash;oh, except that she said, ‘I don’t
like your gambling, and I should hate to be dependent
on your winnings, Arsenio.’&mdash;My God, his
winnings! He leant across the table towards her&mdash;he
seemed to forget me altogether for the minute&mdash;and
said, ‘I never make you even a present
out of them except when I back Number 21.’ She
blushed at that, like a girl just out of the schoolroom.
Rather funny! Some secret between them,
I suppose. The beggar was always backing twenty-one;
though he very seldom brings it off. What’s
his superstition? Did he meet her when she was
twenty-one, or marry her when she was, or was it
the date when they got married, or what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s the date&mdash;the day of the month&mdash;when she
and Waldo didn’t get married,” I explained.</p>

<p>“By Jove! Then they’re&mdash;they’re lovers still!”
The inference which Godfrey thus drew seemed to
affect him considerably. He sat silent for a minute
or two, apparently reflecting on it and frowning
sullenly. Then he went on. “Then Valdez said,
with one of his grins, ‘Mr. Frost can give you news
of some old friends, Lucinda.’ She wasn’t a bit
embarrassed at that, but she didn’t seem interested
either. She was just decently polite about it&mdash;hoped
they were all well, was sorry to hear of Waldo’s
wound, wished she had happened to meet you
and asked if you were coming back&mdash;I’d mentioned
that you’d gone to Paris on this job of yours. In
fact, she didn’t shirk the subject of the family, but
she treated it as something that didn’t matter to
her; she looked as if she was thinking of something
else all the time. She often gives you that
kind of impression. Valdez had never referred
again to her joining us at the hotel&mdash;staying there
with us, I mean; and he said nothing about it at
this meeting. I could only suppose that she had
refused. And now, when she got up to go, he didn’t
propose that we, or even he himself, should escort
her. I made some suggestion of the kind, but she
just said, ‘Oh, no, thank you, I’d rather go by
myself.’ And off she went&mdash;about half-past nine.
We finished the evening playing baccarat&mdash;at least
I did&mdash;at the little hell to which he had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
taken me. He seemed very much at home there;
all the people of the place knew him, laughed and
joked with him; but he didn’t often play there; he
doesn’t much care about baccarat. He used to sit
talking with the proprietor, a fat old Jew, in the
corner, or chatting with the fellow who changed
your money for you, with whom he seemed on particularly
friendly terms. All that part of it was
a bore, but she always went away early, and one
had to finish the evenings somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then she came again, did she?” I asked.</p>

<p>“She came to dinner the next three nights; once
again to dine with Arsenio; he’d got some funds
from somewhere and actually insisted on paying for
those two dinners&mdash;I was footing the general hotel
bill, of course; twice as my guest. She was always
much the same; cool, quiet, reserved, but quite pleasant
and amused. Presently I got the idea that she
was amused at me. I caught her looking at me
sometimes with a smile and a sort of ruminative
look in her eyes; once, when I smiled back, she
gave a little laugh. The fact is, I suppose, she
saw I admired her a good deal. Well, that brought
us to the Thursday. I had to go over to the works
that day, and I spent the night with our manager.
I didn’t get back till Friday evening, and then I
found that Valdez, getting bored, I suppose, and
having some money in his pocket, had gone off to
Monte Carlo. Rather cool, but I expect he couldn’t
help it. He left word that he’d be back next day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
I spent an infernally dull evening by myself at that
dreary little hole of a hotel. I almost had the
car out again and went back to Villa San Carlo,
It would have saved a lot of trouble if I had!</p>

<p>“I’m not going to tell you what I felt; I’m not
good at it. I’ll tell you what I did, and you can
draw your own conclusions. I was quit of Valdez
for a bit; I spent all the next day on my feet, prowling
about the town, looking for her; because, after
all, she must be somewhere in the place. And I
knew that she had a job. So I reckoned the likeliest
chance to happen on her in the streets was
during the <i>déjeuner</i> hour. So I didn’t lunch, but
prowled round all that hour. My next best chance
would be the going home hour; you see that?”</p>

<p>“The business mind applied to gallantry is wonderful,”
I replied. “Now a mere poet would have
lain on the sofa and dreamt of Donna Lucinda!”</p>

<p>“But I had to put in the time in between&mdash;always
with the off-chance, of course. I got pretty tired,
and, when I found myself up at Cimiez about four
o’clock, I felt like a cup of tea, so I turned into
the first hotel I came to. One of those big affairs,
with palm gardens and what not; the ‘Imperial
Palace’ it called itself, I think. I pushed through
one of those revolving doors and came into a lounge
place&mdash;you know the sort of thing?</p>

<p>“I sat down at a table about halfway down the
lounge and ordered tea. Then I lit a cigarette and
looked about me. Round about the door there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
were a lot of showcases, fitted on to the wall, with
jewelry, silver plate, and so on, displayed in them.
There was another large one, full of embroidered
linen and lace things; it was open, and at it, sampling
the goods and chattering away like one o’clock,
were Mrs. Forrester and Eunice Unthank&mdash;no, not
Nina too, thank Heaven! Because the neat girl
who was selling, or trying to sell, the stuff, was
Madame Valdez! I picked up a copy of the day
before yesterday’s <i>Temps</i> from the next table, held
it before my face, and peered at them over it. She
wasn’t in her blue frock now; she wore plain black,
with a bit of white round the neck; short skirt and
black silk stockings. They brought my tea; I drank
it with one hand and held the <i>Temps</i> up with the
other; naturally I didn’t want Mrs. Forrester and
Eunice to see me!</p>

<p>“They were the deuce of a time&mdash;Lord, I could
buy or sell half Europe in the time a woman takes
over a pocket-handkerchief!&mdash;but I didn’t mind
that; I had my plan. At last they went; she did
up their parcel and went with them to the door, with
lots of ‘Thank you’ and ‘Good-by’ (they spoke English)
on both sides. It was past five; I waited still,
and meanwhile finished and paid for my tea. I saw
her making entries in a ledger; then she went
through the case, checking her stock, I suppose;
then, just as a clock struck five-thirty, she shut the
case with a little bang and turned the key; then
she disappeared into a cupboard or something, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
came back in her hat and jacket. By that time
I was by the door, with my hat and stick in my
hand. We met just by her case&mdash;which, by the
way, had on it in large gilt letters, <i>Maison de la
Belle Étoile</i>, Nice.</p>

<p>“‘Good-evening,’ I said. ‘May I have the pleasure
of walking home with you, Madame Valdez?’</p>

<p>“She didn’t seem surprised. ‘I’m Mademoiselle
Lucie here,’ she said, smiling. ‘Oh, yes, if you like.
Take me down to the Promenade&mdash;by the sea. I’m
half stifled.’</p>

<p>“We said hardly anything on the way down&mdash;at
any rate, nothing of any importance; and it was
dusk; I could see her face only dimly. When we
got to the Promenade, and the wind from the sea
caught us in the face, she sighed, ‘Ah!’ and suddenly
took my arm. ‘Was it a fluke, or did you come
to look for me? Did Arsenio tell you?’</p>

<p>“‘No, he didn’t. I’ve hunted the town all day
for you. And I’ve found you at last. Arsenio’s
gone to Monte Carlo.’</p>

<p>“‘I know he has. Why did you want to find me?
You needn’t worry about me. I’m all right. I’ve
got a very good situation now. I find it’s easier
work to sell things than to make them, Mr. Frost.
And the <i>patrons</i> are pleased with me. They say
I have an ingratiating way that produces business!
I wonder whether I was ingratiating with that
woman and girl just now! They spent three hundred
francs!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know the sudden change that comes in
her voice when she means to be extra friendly?
I can’t begin to describe it&mdash;something like the jolliest
kitten in the world purring! No, that’s absurd&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
well! What she said was, ‘I like
you and I like your dinners. But aren’t you rather
silly to do it?’ Yes, she was very friendly, but
just a bit contemptuous too. ‘Because you’re a great
young man, aren’t you? And I’m a <i>midinette</i>!
Besides, you know about me, I expect. And so
you’ll know that Arsenio and I are married. Ask
your cousin, Mr. Frost.’</p>

<p>“All I said was, ‘I’m glad you like me.’ She
laughed. ‘And you like me? Why?’</p>

<p>“Then I made a most damned fool of myself,
Julius. I don’t really know how I came to do it,
except that the thing’s true, of course. I’ve laughed
at the thing myself ever since I laughed at anything&mdash;in
revues, and <i>Punch</i>, and everywhere. I
said,&mdash;yes, by Jove, I did!&mdash;I said, ‘You’re so different
from other women, Donna Lucinda!’</p>

<p>“What an ass! Of course you can’t help laughing
too, Julius! But, after all, I’m glad I did make
such an ass of myself, because she just burst into
an honest guffaw&mdash;and so did I, a minute later.
We became a thousand times better friends just
in that minute.”</p>

<p>Godfrey paused in his narrative and gazed at
me. I am afraid that a smile still lingered on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
face. “You didn’t do yourself justice; you tell the
story very well,” I said.</p>

<p>“Of course I wasn’t quite such an ass as I
sounded,” said he. “What I really meant, but
couldn’t exactly have said, was&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know exactly what it was, Godfrey. But I
think it was much cleverer of you to know you meant
it than it is of me to know that you meant it. You
meant that Donna Lucinda Valdez has a personality
markedly different from that possessed by Lady
Dundrannan?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose that I did know that I meant
it&mdash;at that moment.”</p>

<p>“But you know that you mean it now?”</p>

<p>“That&mdash;and more,” he said.</p>

<p>“Your idea of seeing whether Arsenio’s system
worked seems to have led you a little further than
you contemplated,” I observed. He had chaffed
me that evening, after my dinner at Arsenio’s&mdash;or
Nina’s&mdash;expense; he had aired his shrewdness. I
seemed entitled to give him a dig.</p>

<p>“Are you surprised?” he asked, after a pause,
suddenly, taking not the least heed of my gibe.</p>

<p>There were a hundred flippant answers that I
might have given him. But I gave him none of
them. His young, strong face wore a dour look&mdash;the
look of a man up against something big, determined
to tackle it, not yet seeing how. The animation
which had filled him, as he warmed to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
story, had for the moment worked itself out. He
looked dull, heavy, tired.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not surprised,” I said. “But what’s
the use? You know her story.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” he demanded,
rather peremptorily.</p>

<p>“She threw up everything in the world for Arsenio
Valdez; she still blushes like a school-girl
when Arsenio backs Number 21. They’re lovers
still, as you yourself said a little while ago. Well,
then&mdash;&mdash;! Besides&mdash;there’s Nina. Are you going
to&mdash;desert?”</p>

<p>“Nina?” He repeated the name half-absently;
perhaps the larger share of his attention was occupied
by the other part of my remarks. “Yes,
Nina, of course!” But, as he dwelt on the thought
of Lady Dundrannan (suddenly, as it seemed, recalled
to his mind), his look of depression disappeared.
He smiled in amusement&mdash;with an element
of wonder in it; and he spoke as if he were
surprising me with a wonderful discovery.</p>

<p>“I say, Julius, Lucinda positively laughs at Nina,
you know!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">PURPLE&mdash;AND FINE LINEN</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THAT Lucinda had once got the better of
Nina had been the thing about her which
most stirred Godfrey’s curiosity; that Lucinda
now laughed at Nina evidently aroused in him
an almost incredulous wonder. Perhaps it was calculated
to surprise any one; to a Frost it must have
seemed portentous; for Frosts, father, daughter,
and nephew, judged by what you did and, consequently,
had, not by what you were. Judged by their
standards, Lucinda’s laughter was ridiculous, but in
Godfrey’s fascinated eyes also sublime: such a sublime
audacity as only a supremely attractive woman
dare and can carry. The needlewoman, the <i>midinette</i>,
the showcase girl, laughing at Lady Dundrannan!
But there it was. I think that it shook to
its foundations something that was very deeply set
in Godfrey Frost.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose Lucinda knew that you were
seeing her on the sly,” I suggested.</p>

<p>He flushed a little. “I don’t particularly like that
way of putting it. I’m not responsible to Nina for
my actions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. He lit another cigarette,
and suddenly resumed his story.</p>

<p>“Well, this is what happened. Arsenio didn’t
come back; I suppose he won a bit, or kept his head
above water somehow. I stayed in Nice, seeing a lot
of Lucinda, for about another week. I used to go
up to that hotel for lunch or tea, and put in the
time somehow till she knocked off work. Then we
had our walk; once or twice she dined with me, but
she was rather difficult about that. She always
kept just the same as she was at the beginning,
except that, as I say, she liked to hear about Nina,
and seemed a lot amused at what I told her&mdash;Nina’s
sort of managing ways, and&mdash;and dignity, and so
on. By the way, she asked about you too sometimes;
what you’d been doing since she last heard
from you, and so on. Apparently you used to write
to her?”</p>

<p>“Just occasionally&mdash;when I was on my travels.
I hope she spoke kindly of me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that was all right,” he assured me carelessly.
“Well, then came her weekly afternoon off;
it was on a Friday she had it; she got off at half-past twelve.
I had managed to persuade her to
lunch with me, and I went up to the hotel to fetch
her. I was a bit early, and I walked up and down
just outside the hotel gardens, waiting for her. Nobody
was further from my thoughts at that moment
than Nina, but just at a quarter past twelve&mdash;I’d
looked at my watch the moment before&mdash;I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
a big car come up the road. I recognized it directly.
It was Nina’s.”</p>

<p>“Rather odd! How did she find out that&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“This is what must have happened, so far as I’ve
been able to piece it together. Those two women&mdash;Mrs.
Forrester, you know, and Eunice Unthank&mdash;went
back to Villa San Carlo with their three hundred
francs’ worth of stuff, and told Nina about
Mademoiselle Lucie; described her, I suppose, as
something out of the common; they naturally
would, finding a girl of her appearance, obviously
English, and a lady, doing that job. Nina’s as
sharp as a needle, and it’s quite possible that the
description by itself was enough to put her on
the scent; though, for my own part, I’ve always had
my doubts whether she didn’t know more about the
Valdez’s than she chose to admit; something in her
manner when I brought the conversation round to
them&mdash;and I did sometimes&mdash;always gave me that
impression. Anyhow, there she was, and Eunice
Unthank with her.”</p>

<p>“That must have been a week&mdash;or nearly&mdash;since
she’d heard about Mademoiselle Lucie from the
two women. Had you heard anything from her
in the interval?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d had two letters from her, addressed
to our works and forwarded on&mdash;I had to leave an
address at the works&mdash;saying they missed me at
the Villa and asking when I expected to be back;
but I hadn’t answered them. I didn’t exactly know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
what to say, you see, so I said nothing. As a matter
of fact, I felt bored at the idea of going back;
but I couldn’t have said that, could I?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. And so&mdash;at last&mdash;she had to
come?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘at last’? And why had
she to come?”</p>

<p>There was in my mind a vivid imagining of what
that week had been to Lady Dundrannan; a week of
irresolution and indecision, of pride struggling
against her old jealousy, her old memory of defeat
and shame. To seem to take any interest in the
woman was beneath her; yet her interest in the
woman was intense. And if an encounter could
seem quite accidental&mdash;&mdash;? Why shouldn’t it? Just
the two women’s report&mdash;no hasty appearance after
it&mdash;quite a natural thing to motor over to Cimiez
for lunch! And, given that the encounter was quite
accidental, it admitted no interest; it would satisfy
curiosity; she had the power of turning it into a
triumph. And Godfrey&mdash;her <i>protégé</i>, her property&mdash;had
been missing a week and had left two letters
unanswered. My own talk with her&mdash;just before
I came away&mdash;returned to my mind.</p>

<p>“I suppose that Lady Eunice&mdash;or Mrs. Forrester&mdash;kept
on worrying her. Was that it?” My attempt
to explain away the form of my question was
not very convincing. Godfrey disposed of it unceremoniously.</p>

<p>“If you were really such a damned fool as you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
trying to appear, I shouldn’t be here talking to you,”
he remarked. “There was more in it than that of
course.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell me what happened. We can discuss
it afterwards,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Just what happened? All right&mdash;and soon told.
Nina saw me walking up and down, smoking. She
smiled what they call brightly; so did Lady Eunice.
One or other of them pulled the string, I suppose;
the car stopped; the chauffeur lay back in his seat
in the resigned sort of way those chaps have when
they’re stopped for some silly reason or other&mdash;most
reasons do seem to appear silly to them, don’t
they? Really superior chauffeurs, I mean, such as
Nina’s bound to have. I took off my hat and went
up to the car. ‘Why, it’s Mr. Frost!’ said Eunice,
just as surprised as you’d have expected her to be.”</p>

<p>“I certainly acquit Lady Eunice of malice aforethought,”
said I.</p>

<p>“‘And who’d have thought of meeting him
here?’ said Nina. You know that smile of hers?”</p>

<p>“Have I found thee, O my enemy?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I must say that you do know a thing
or two about Nina. ‘I thought you were in Nice
all the time!’ she went on&mdash;oh, quite pleasantly.
‘We’ll take him in to lunch and make him give
an account of himself, won’t we, Eunice? He’s
deserted us disgracefully!’ You never saw anybody
more amiable. And Lady Eunice was awfully cordial
too&mdash;‘Oh, yes, you must lunch with us, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Frost, and tell us what you’ve been doing. We’ve
been very dull, haven’t we, Lady Dundrannan?’
The thing seemed going so well”&mdash;here Godfrey
gave one of the reflective smiles which witnessed
to the humor that lay in him, though it was deeply
hidden under other and more serviceable qualities&mdash;“that
the chauffeur, after a yawn, got down from
his seat and opened the door of the car for me to
get in. And I was just going to get in&mdash;hypnotized
or something, I suppose&mdash;when down the drive from
the hotel came Donna Lucinda. She came along with
that free swinging walk of hers, as independent and
unconcerned as you please, in her neat, plain, black
frock, and carrying one of those big, round, shiny
black boxes that you see the <i>midinettes</i> with. Only
her stockings looked a shade smarter than most of
them run to. Of course she didn’t know the car by
sight as I did&mdash;some people think that yellow too
showy, but I like it myself, provided you’ve got a
good car to show it off on&mdash;and I suppose I was
hidden, or half hidden by it. At any rate, she came
sailing down the hotel drive all serene. And I don’t
think I’ve ever seen her looking more splendid in
all my life!”</p>

<p>“You’d known her for just about a week.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, damn it, in all the week that I had
known her. I do wish you wouldn’t interrupt me,
Julius!”</p>

<p>“I don’t interrupt you half as much as you interrupt
yourself. I want to know what happened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
What’s the good of gassing about the chauffeur and
the color of the car?”</p>

<p>“Well, to me that’s all part of the picture&mdash;I
suppose I can’t make it for you. The big yellow
car&mdash;a three thousand wouldn’t nearly cover it nowadays,
you know&mdash;and Jefferson, a tall, slim chap,
dark; been a company sergeant-major&mdash;oh, damned
genteel!&mdash;Lady Eunice quite out of the situation&mdash;as
she would be&mdash;but&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;a
little patrician all over&mdash;and Nina&mdash;at her most
stately! Over against all that&mdash;and it was rather
overpowering; I can tell you I felt it&mdash;the <i>midinette</i>
with her box walking down the drive. That girl&mdash;she
didn’t look more than a girl, I swear, though
I suppose she’s five-and-twenty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And who were you going to lunch with?” I interrupted
again. I could not help it. I think that
I laughed, shortly and rather harshly. A ridiculous
little <i>impasse</i> it seemed for him. He had told his
story clumsily, but somehow he had brought the
scene before my eyes. Memory helped me, I imagine;
it put more into the figure swinging down
the drive, more into her stately ladyship seated in
that challenging, possibly too showy, yellow car.
“Which of them did you lunch with?” I laughed
on the question, but I was rather excited.</p>

<p>He had stopped smoking; he sat in a rather odd
attitude&mdash;upright, with his legs so close together
that they left only just room for him to thrust
his hands, held together as if he were saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
his prayers, between them just above the knees.</p>

<p>“After all&mdash;was it a matter of so much importance?
A lunch!” I mocked.</p>

<p>He didn’t pay attention to that, and he did not
change his position. “Then Nina saw her. Things
are funny. She’d come on purpose to see her, of
course. Still, when she did, her mouth suddenly
went stiff&mdash;you know what I mean? She didn’t
move, though; it was just her mouth. And I stood
there like a fool&mdash;actually with one foot on the
ground and one on the step of the car, I believe;
and Jefferson stifling another yawn beside me!</p>

<p>“Donna Lucinda came through the gate of the
drive and up to where the car was standing; it
was sideways on to the gate; Lady Eunice sat on
the side near the gate, I was on the other side,
with Nina between us. Lucinda seemed to see Eunice
first, and to recognize her; she made a very
slight formal little bow&mdash;as she would to a customer.
The next second her eyes fell on Nina and
on me. She stopped short, just by the car. Her
cheeks flushed a little, and she gave a little low
exclamation&mdash;‘Oh!’ or ‘Ah!’&mdash;I hardly heard it.
Then, ‘It’s Nina!’ That was hardly louder. I just
heard it. Eunice, of course, must have and Nina;
I doubt whether Jefferson could. Then she gave a
queer little laugh&mdash;what you’d call a chuckle coming
from an ordinary person&mdash;as if she were laughing
to herself, inwardly amused, but not expecting
anybody else to share her amusement. She didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
look a bit put out or awkward. But the next moment
she smiled directly at me&mdash;across the other
two&mdash;and shook her head&mdash;sympathizing with me
in my predicament, I think.</p>

<p>“Nina made her a stately bow. She was very dignified,
but a little flushed too. She looked somehow
disturbed and puzzled. It seemed as if she
really were shocked and upset to see Lucinda like
that. The next moment she leant right across
Eunice, throwing out her hand towards the bandbox
that Lucinda was carrying.</p>

<p>“‘Surely there’s no need for you to do that?’ she
said, speaking very low. ‘And&mdash;I hope you’re
better?’</p>

<p>“Lucinda spoke up quite loud. ‘I like it, thank
you. There’s every need for me to earn my living;
and I’ve never been better in my life, thank you.’</p>

<p>“Nina turned her head round to the chauffeur.
‘I’ll call you, Jefferson.’ He touched his hat and
strolled off along the road, taking out a cigarette
case. Nina turned back to Lucinda, leaning again
across Lady Eunice, who was sitting back in her seat,
looking rather frightened; I don’t know whether she
knew who Lucinda was; I don’t think so; but it
must have been pretty evident to her that there was
thunder in the air.</p>

<p>“‘How long have you been doing this? Does
your husband know you’re doing it?’</p>

<p>“Her questions sounded sharp and peremptory;
Lucinda might well have resented them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Of course he knows; he’s known it for three
months. It’s just that I like to be independent.’
She gave a little bow with that, as if she meant to
end the conversation, but before she could walk on&mdash;if
that was what she meant to do&mdash;Nina flung
herself back on the cushions, exclaiming in a low
voice, but passionately, ‘How dare he tell me lies
like that!’</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean&mdash;&mdash;?’ Lucinda began. But
Nina would not wait for her. ‘Call Jefferson,’ she
told me. ‘Are you coming with us, Godfrey?’</p>

<p>“I called Jefferson, and then answered her question.
‘Thanks awfully, but I’m afraid I can’t. I’m
engaged to lunch.’ And I shut the door of the car
which Jefferson had left still open.</p>

<p>“She looked from me to Lucinda, and back again
to me. It <i>was</i> a look that I got, I can tell you! But
if you’re going to stand up to Nina, you must do
it thoroughly. I looked her full in the eye; of course
she saw that I meant I was going to lunch with
Lucinda. ‘Drive on&mdash;to the hotel, Jefferson,’ she
said in that dry voice of hers that means she’s furiously
angry. Off the car went, in at the gates&mdash;and
I was left standing on the road opposite Donna
Lucinda.”</p>

<p>Godfrey got up from his seat and walked across
to the fireplace; he appeared to have exhausted his
matches, for he searched for a box there, and found
one at last, hidden under a newspaper on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“So, in the end, you lunched with Lucinda, after
all?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, “I didn’t lunch with Lucinda,
as it happened. When I took a step up to
her, she seemed absolutely lost in her own thoughts,
hardly aware of my being there, at least realizing
that I was there with a sort of effort; her eyes didn’t
look as if they saw me at all. ‘You must let me
off to-day, Mr. Frost,’ she said in a hurried murmur.
‘I&mdash;I’ve got something to do&mdash;something I
must think about.’ Her cheeks were still rather
red; otherwise she was calm enough, but obviously
entirely preoccupied. It would have been silly to
press her; I mean, it would have been an intrusion.
‘All right, of course,’ I said. ‘But when are we to
meet again, Donna Lucinda?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know. In a few days, I hope. Not
till I send you word to the hotel.’</p>

<p>“‘Try to make it Sunday.’ I smiled as I added,
‘Then I shall see you in the blue frock; that’s the
one I like best.’</p>

<p>“‘The blue frock!’ she repeated after me. Then
she suddenly raised her free arm&mdash;she’d been holding
that infernal bandbox all the time, you know&mdash;clenched
her fist and gave it a little shake in the
air. ‘If he’s really done that, I’ll have no more
to do with him in this world again!’ she said. And
off she went down the road, without another word
to me or a glance back. I believe she’d forgotten
my very existence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did she turn up on Sunday&mdash;in the blue frock?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never set eyes on her since&mdash;nor on Arsenio
either. They both appear to have vanished
into space&mdash;together or separately, Heaven only
knows! I hunted for Valdez in all the likely places.
I tried for her at the hotel at Cimiez, at her shop,
at her lodgings. I’ve drawn blank everywhere. I
got thoroughly sick and out of heart. So I thought
I’d run up here and see what you thought about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I should make any mystery
about it,” said I. “Anything that puzzles you will
be quite plain in the light of that letter.”</p>

<p>I took the letter from Arsenio Valdez, which Nina
had given me, out of my pocket, and flung it down
on the table. “Read it&mdash;and you’ll understand why
she repeated after you ‘The blue frock!’ That was
what gave her the clew to Nina’s meaning!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">REBELLION</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THERE was the situation; for Godfrey was
quick enough to see what had happened as
soon as he had read Arsenio’s letter; he finished
it, which was more than I had done, and so
found more lies than I had. We discussed the situation
far into the night, Godfrey still doing most
of the talking. He had come to Paris to see me
about it, to ask my advice or to put some question
to me; but he had not really got the problem clear
in his mind. On subsidiary points&mdash;or, perhaps, one
should rather say, on what seemed such to him&mdash;his
view was characteristic, and to me amusing. He
thought that most of Nina’s anger was due to the
fact that she had been “done” by Arsenio, that he
had got her money for Lucinda and for himself on
false pretenses; whereas Nina was really furious
with Lucinda herself for not having consciously
accepted her charity, and made comparatively little
of friend Arsenio’s roguery. He was much more
full of admiration of Lucinda for not minding being
discovered carrying a bandbox&mdash;and for laughing
at her encounter with Lady Dundrannan while she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was doing it&mdash;than of appreciation of her indignation
over the blue frock; he thought she made a
great deal too much of that. “Since she didn’t
know, what does it come to?” he asked. And he
wasted no reprobation on Arsenio. He had known
Arsenio for a rogue before&mdash;a rogue after his
money, and willing to use his wife as a bait to catch
it; that he now knew that Arsenio was more completely
a rogue all round&mdash;towards Nina as well as
towards him&mdash;was merely a bit of confirmatory evidence;
he saw nothing in the fact that Arsenio had,
after all, given Lucinda the blue frock, though he
would have been quite safe&mdash;as safe, anyhow&mdash;if
he had given her nothing. His whole analysis, so
far as it appeared in disjointed observations, of
the other parties to the affair, ran on lines of obvious
shrewdness, and was baffled only where they
appeared&mdash;as in Lucinda’s case&mdash;to diverge from
the lines thus indicated. Lucinda was a puzzle.
Why had she hidden herself from him? She could
“have it out” with Valdez, if she wanted to, without
doing that!</p>

<p>But he was not immensely perturbed at her temporary
disappearance; he could find her, if he
wanted to. “It’s only a matter of trouble and
money, like anything else.” And if she were furious
with Valdez, no harm in that! Rather the reverse!
Thus he gradually approached his own position,
and the questions which he was putting to himself,
and had found so difficult that he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
impelled to come and talk them over. These really
might be reduced to one, and a very old one, though
also often a very big one; it may be variously conceived
and described as that between prudence and
passion, that between morality and love, that between
will and emotion, between the head and the
heart. For purposes of the present case it could
be personified as being between Nina and Lucinda.
As a gentleman, if as nothing more, he had been
obliged to own up to his engagement to lunch with
Lucinda and to stand by it. But that act settled
nothing ultimately. The welcome of a returning
Prodigal would await him at Villa San Carlo,
though the feast might perhaps be rather too highly
peppered with a lofty forgiveness; he was conscious
of that feature in the case, but minded it less than
I should have; Nina’s pupil was accustomed to her
rebukes, and rather hardened against her chastisement.
But if arms were open to him elsewhere&mdash;soft
and seducing arms&mdash;what then? Was he
to desert Nina?</p>

<p>Her and what she stood for? And really, in this
situation, she stood for everything that had, up to
now, governed his life. She stood (she would not
have felt at all inadequate to the demand on her
qualities) for prosperity, progress, propriety, and&mdash;as
a climax&mdash;for piety itself. Godfrey had been
religiously brought up (the figure of the white-haired
Wesleyan Minister at Briarmount rose before
my eyes) and was not ashamed to own that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the principles thus inculcated had influenced his doings
and were still a living force in him. I respected
him for the avowal; it is not one that men
are very ready to make where a woman is in question;
it had been implicit in his reason for knowing
nothing of women, given to me a long time ago&mdash;that
he had not been able to afford to marry.</p>

<p>Piety was the highest impersonation which Nina
was called upon to undertake. Was it the most
powerful, the most compelling? There were so
many others, whose images somehow blended into
one great and imposing Figure&mdash;Regularity, with her
cornucopia of worldly advantages, not necessarily
lost (Godfrey was quite awake to that) by a secret
dallying with her opposite, but thereby rendered
insincere&mdash;that counted with him&mdash;uneasy, and perpetually
precarious. He was a long-headed young
man; he foresaw every chance against his passion&mdash;even
the chance that, having first burnt up all he
had or hoped for, it would itself become extinct.
Then it was not true passion? I don’t know. It
was strong enough. Lucinda impersonated too; impersonated
things that are very powerful.</p>

<p>He spoke of her seldom and evasively. In the
debate which he carried on with himself&mdash;only occasionally
asking for an opinion from me&mdash;he generally
indicated her under the description of “the
other thing”&mdash;other (it was to be understood) from
all that Nina represented. Taken like that, the description,
if colorless, was at least comprehensive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
And it did get Lucinda&mdash;bluntly, yet not altogether
wrongly. He saw her as an ideal&mdash;the exact opposite
of the ideal to which he had hitherto aspired,
the ideal of regularity, wealth, eminence, reputation,
power, thirty per cent., and so on (including,
let us not forget, piety). So seen, she astonished
him in herself, and astonished him more by the lure
that she had for him. Only he distrusted the lure
profoundly. In the end he could not understand
it in himself. I do not blame him; I myself was
considerably puzzled at finding it in him. To say
that a man is in love is a summary, not an explanation.
Jonathan Frost&mdash;old Lord Dundrannan&mdash;had
been a romantic in his way; Nina too in hers,
when she had sobbed in passion on the cliffs&mdash;or
even now, when she cherished disturbing emotions
about things and people whom she might, without
loss of comfort or profit, have serenely disregarded.
There was a thread of the romantic meandering
through the more challenging patterns of the family
fabric.</p>

<p>Half a dozen times I was on the point of flying
into a rage with him&mdash;when he talked easily of
“buying Valdez,” when he assumed Lucinda’s assent
to that not very pretty transaction, when he
hinted at the luxury which would reward that assent,
and so on. But the genuineness of his conflict, of
his scruples on the one hand, of his passion on the
other, made anger seem cruel, while the bluntness
of his perception seemed to make it ridiculous. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
on this latter point I exaggerated a little&mdash;asking
from him an insight into the situation to
which I was helped by a more intimate knowledge
of the past and of the persons; but at all events
he was, as I conceived, radically wrong in his estimate
of the possibilities. At last I was impelled
to tell him so.</p>

<p>It was very late; in disregard of his “Don’t go
yet, I haven’t finished,” I had actually put on my
coat, and taken my hat and stick in my hand. I
stood like that, opposite to where he sat, and expounded
my views to him. I imagine that to a
cool spectator I should have looked rather absurd,
for by now I too was somehow wrought up and
excited; he had got me back into my pre-Paris state
of mind, the one in which I had been when I intimated
to Nina that I must hunt the Riviera for
Lucinda and find out the truth about her at all
costs. The Conference on Tonnage was routed,
driven pell-mell out of my thoughts.</p>

<p>“You can’t buy Valdez,” I told him, “not in the
sense that you mean. He’ll sell himself, body and
soul, for money&mdash;to you, or me, or Nina, or all of
us, or anybody else. But he won’t sell Lucinda. He
sells himself for money, but it’s because of her that
he must have the money&mdash;to dazzle her, to cut a
figure in her eyes, to get her back to him. He used
her to tempt you with, to make you shell out&mdash;just
as he did, in another way, with Nina. But he knew
he was safe; he knew he’d never have to deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
what he was pretending to sell. She’s not only the
one woman to him, she’s the one idea in his head,
the one stake he always plays for. He’d sell his
soul for her, but he wouldn’t sell her in return for
all you have. You sit here, balancing her against
this and that&mdash;now against God, now against Mammon!
He doesn’t set either of them for a moment
in the scales against her.”</p>

<p>If what I said sharpened his perception, it blunted
his scruples. The idea of Valdez’s passion was a
spur to his own.</p>

<p>“Then it’s man against man,” he said in a sullen,
dogged voice. “If I find I can’t buy her, I’ll take
her.”</p>

<p>“You can try. If she lets you, she’s a changed
woman. That’s all I can say. I need hardly add
that I shall not offer you my assistance. Why,
hang it, man, if she’s to be got, why shouldn’t I
have a shot at her myself?”</p>

<p>He gave a short gruff laugh. “I don’t quite associate
the idea with you, but of course you’d be
within your rights, as far as I’m concerned.”</p>

<p>I laughed too. “There’s fair warning to you,
then! And no bad blood, I hope? Also, perhaps,
enough debate on what is, after all, rather a delicate
subject&mdash;a lady’s honor&mdash;as some scrupulous
people might remind us. By way of apology to
the proprieties, I’ll just add that in my private opinion
we should neither of us have the least chance
of success. She may not be Valdez’s any more&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to that I express no opinion, though I have one&mdash;but
I don’t believe she’ll be any one else’s.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?” he grumbled out
surlily.</p>

<p>“She herself makes me say it; she herself and
what I know about her. And, considering your condition,
it seems common kindness to tell you my
view, for what it’s worth. Now, my friend, thanks
for your dinner, and&mdash;good-night!”</p>

<p>“Are you staying here&mdash;in Paris&mdash;much longer?”</p>

<p>“I shall be for a week&mdash;possibly a fortnight&mdash;I
expect.”</p>

<p>“Then good-by as well as good-night; I shall go
back to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“To Villa San Carlo?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know where I shall go. It depends.”</p>

<p>“To where you can test the value of my view,
perhaps?” He had now risen, and I walked across
to him, holding out my hand. He took it, with
another gruff laugh.</p>

<p>“This sort of thing plays hell with a man; but
there’s no need for us to quarrel, Julius?”</p>

<p>“Not at present, at all events. And it looks as
if you had a big enough quarrel on your hands already.”</p>

<p>“Nina? Yes.” It was on that name, and not on
the other, that at last we parted. And I suppose
that he did “go back” the next day; for I saw him
no more during the rest of my stay in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>But a week later&mdash;our “labors” being “protracted”
to that extent and longer&mdash;I had an encounter
that gave me indirect news of him, as well
as direct news of other members of the Rillington-cum-Dundrannan
family. To my surprise, I met
my cousin Waldo in the Rue de la Paix. Nina and
he&mdash;and Eunice&mdash;were on their way home. In the
first place, Sir Paget had written that Aunt Bertha
was seedy and moping, and wondering when they
would be back. In the second, Nina had got restless
and tired of Mentone, while he himself was
so much better that there was no longer any reason
to stay there on his account.</p>

<p>“In fact, we got a bit bored with ourselves,”
Waldo confessed as he took my arm and we walked
along together, “after we lost you two fellows.
Dull for the ladies. Oh, I know you couldn’t help
yourself, old fellow; this job here was too big to
miss. But we lost Godfrey too.” His voice fell
to a confidential pitch, and he smiled slyly as he
pressed my arm. “Well, you know, dear Nina is
given to making her plans, bless her! And she’s
none too pleased when they don’t come off, is she?
I rather fancy that she had a little plan on at the
Villa&mdash;Eunice Unthank, you know&mdash;and a nice girl
she is&mdash;and that Godfrey didn’t feel like coming
up to the scratch. So he tactfully had business at
the works that kept him away from the Villa. Do
you see what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose he was better away if he didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
mean to play up. If he’d stayed, it might have put
ideas in the girl’s head that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly, old chap. Though we were awfully
sorry he went, still that was the view Nina took
about it. I think she was right.”</p>

<p>Facts had supplied a sufficient explanation of my
disappearance from Villa San Carlo; here plainly
was the official version of Godfrey’s. In order to
cover a great defeat, Lady Dundrannan, with her
usual admirable tactics, acknowledged a minor one.
It was a quite sufficient explanation to offer to unsuspecting
Waldo; and it was certainly true, so far
as it went; the Eunice-Godfrey project had miscarried.</p>

<p>“I liked the girl and I’m sorry,” said Waldo.
“But there’s lots of time, and of course, the world
being what it is, he can always make a good marriage.”
He laughed gently. “But I suppose women
always like to manage a man’s future for him, if they
can, don’t they?”</p>

<p>His ignorance of the great defeat was evidently
entire; his wife had looked after that. But it was
interesting to observe that&mdash;as a concomitant, perhaps,
of his returning physical vigor&mdash;his mind gave
hints of a new independence. He had not ceased
to love and admire his wife&mdash;there was no reason
why he ever should&mdash;but his smile at her foible was
something new&mdash;since his marriage, I mean. The
limit thus indicated to his Dundrannanization was
welcome to me, a Rillington. What the smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
pointed to was, the next moment, confirmed by the
sigh with which he added, pursuing what was to
him apparently the same train of thought, “Nina’s
against our living at Cragsfoot when I succeed.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you will marry thumping heiresses, with
half a dozen palaces of their own&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, old man. Still&mdash;well, I can’t expect
her to share my feeling about it, can I?” He
smiled again, this time rather ruefully. “In fact,
she’s pressing me to settle the matter now.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Sir Paget’s still alive!
Is she asking for a promise, or what?”</p>

<p>“She wants me to sell my remainder&mdash;subject to
my father’s life-interest. Nina likes things definitely
settled, you see. She doesn’t like Cragsfoot.” To
my considerable surprise, he accompanied these last
words with a very definite wink. A smile, a sigh,
a wink&mdash;yes, Waldo was recovering some independence
of thought, if not of action. But in this
affair it was his action that mattered, not his
thoughts. Still, the fact remained that his wink
was an unmistakable reference to the past&mdash;to Lucinda.</p>

<p>“Sir Paget wouldn’t like it, would he?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid not&mdash;not the idea of it, at first.
But a man is told to cleave to his wife. After
all, if I have a son to inherit it, he wouldn’t be
Rillington of Cragsfoot, he’d be Dundrannan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course he would. I’d forgotten. But does
it make much difference?”</p>

<p>“And amongst all the rest of it, Cragsfoot
wouldn’t be much more than an appendage. I love
Nina, Julius, but I wish sometimes that she wasn’t
quite so damned rich! Don’t think for an instant
that she ever rams it down my throat. She never
would.”</p>

<p>“My dear chap, I know her. I’m sure she’d be
incapable of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But there the fact is. And it creates&mdash;well, a
certain situation. I say, I’m not keeping you? My
ladies are shopping, and I’ve an hour off, but if
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ve time to hear anything you want to say.
And you’re not tired?”</p>

<p>“Strong as a horse now. I enjoy walking. Look
here, old chap. Of course, there are lots of these
‘new rich,’ as the papers call them, who’d pay a
long price for Cragsfoot, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thinking of anybody in particular?” I put in.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” He laughed&mdash;almost one of his
old hearty laughs. “Well, yes. Have you ever
had any reason&mdash;&mdash;? I mean, it’s funny you should
ask that.”</p>

<p>“Something a certain friend of ours once let fall
set me thinking.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that idea took shape, if Nina wanted
it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Perhaps in the end she wouldn’t! I was thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
that possibly the course of events might cause
Lady Dundrannan not to wish to see her cousin&mdash;and
his establishment&mdash;at Cragsfoot.</p>

<p>“If she did&mdash;and he did,” Waldo went on, “well,
I should be in a tight corner. Because, of course,
he could outbid practically everybody, if he chose&mdash;and
what reason for objecting could I give?”</p>

<p>“You seem to have something in your mind.
You’re looking&mdash;for you&mdash;quite crafty! Out
with it!”</p>

<p>“Well, supposing I’d promised that, if I sold, I’d
give you first offer?”</p>

<p>Waldo had delivered himself of his idea&mdash;and it
seemed nothing less than a proposal to put a spoke
in the wheel of his wife’s plans as he conceived them!
Decidedly rebellion was abroad&mdash;open and covert!
It worked mightily in Godfrey; it was working even
in Waldo.</p>

<p>“I don’t like your selling,” I said. “You’re the
chief&mdash;I’m a cadet. But if you’re forced&mdash;I beg
your pardon, Waldo! If you decide”&mdash;he pressed
my arm again, smiling at my correction, but saying
nothing&mdash;“to go, there’s nothing I should like so
much as to settle down there myself. But I can’t
outbid&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A man doesn’t ask his own kinsman more than
a fair price, when the deal’s part of a family arrangement,”
said Waldo. “May I speak to my
father, and write you a proposal about it? And
we’ll let the matter stand where it does till we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
what he thinks and till you’ve had an opportunity of
considering.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said I, and we walked on a little
way in silence. Then I felt again the slight pressure
on my arm. “Well, here’s where we’re staying. I
promised to meet them at tea. Will you come in?”</p>

<p>I shook my head, murmuring something about
business. He did not press the point. “We’re off
again early to-morrow, and dining with some friends
of Eunice’s to-night. See you again soon at Cragsfoot&mdash;we’re
going to Briarmount. Good-by!”</p>

<p>But that was not quite his last word. He gave
my arm a final squeeze; and he smiled again and
again a little ruefully. “I rather think that, in
his heart, the old pater would prefer what I’ve
suggested even to our&mdash;to any other arrangement,
Julius.”</p>

<p>It was quite as much as it was diplomatic to say
about his father’s feelings on that point. Like the
one which had been discussed by Godfrey and myself,
it might be considered delicate.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WINNING TICKET</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THEN came the astonishing turn of fortune’s
wheel&mdash;that is almost fact, scarcely
metaphor&mdash;which seemed to transform the
whole situation. It came to my knowledge on the
very day on which those protracted labors of ours
reached a conclusion at last.</p>

<p>We had had a long and tedious final session&mdash;for
this time there was not only business to wind up,
but compliments to be exchanged too&mdash;and I came
out of it at half-past six in the evening so exhausted
that I turned into the nearest <i>café</i> at which I was
known, and procured a whisky-and-soda. With it
the waiter brought me a copy of <i>Le Soir</i>, and, as I
sipped my “refresher” and smoked a cigar, I glanced
through it, hoping (to be candid) to find some complimentary
notice of the achievements of my Conference.
I did not find that&mdash;perhaps it was too
soon to expect it&mdash;but I did find something which
interested me a great deal more. Among the miscellaneous
items of “intelligence” I read the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The first prize in yesterday’s draw of the Reparation
Lottery Loan has been won by M. Arsenio
Valdez of Nice. The amount of the prize is three
million francs. The number of the winning ticket
was two hundred and twelve thousand, one hundred
and twenty-one. We understand that the fortunate
winner purchased it for a trifling sum from a chance
acquaintance at Monte Carlo.”</p>

<p class="p1">I re-read the winning number; indeed, I took my
pencil out of my pocket and wrote it down&mdash;in figures&mdash;on
the margin of the newspaper. I believe
that I said softly, “Well, I’m damned!” The astonishing
creature had brought it off at last, and
brought it off to some tune. Three million francs!
Pretty good&mdash;for anybody except the Frosts of this
world, of course!</p>

<p>Aye, Arsenio would buy that ticket from a chance
acquaintance (probably one of the same kidney as
himself) if he had the coin, or could beg, borrow,
or steal it! Number 212, 121! There it was three
times over&mdash;21&mdash;21&mdash;21. He would have seemed
to himself absolutely mad if he had let that ticket
escape him, when chance threw it in his way. It
was, indeed, as though Fortune said, “I have teased
you long enough, O faithful votary, but I give myself
to you at last!” And she had&mdash;she actually
had. Arsenio’s long quest was accomplished.</p>

<p>What would he do with it, I pondered, as I
puffed and sipped. I saw him resplendent again as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
he had been on that never forgotten Twenty-first,
and smiling in monkeyish triumph over all of us who
had mocked him for a fool. I even saw him paying
back Nina and Godfrey Frost, though possibly this
was a detail which might be omitted, as being a distasteful
reminder of his days of poverty. I saw
him dazzling Lucinda with something picturesquely
extravagant, a pearl necklace or a carpet of banknotes&mdash;what
you will in that line. I heard him
saying to her, “Number twenty-one! Always
twenty-one. <i>Your</i> number, Lucinda!” And I saw
her flushing like a girl just out of the schoolroom,
as Godfrey had seen her flush at Nice.</p>

<p>Ah, Godfrey Frost! This event was&mdash;to put
the thing vulgarly&mdash;one in the eye for him, wasn’t
it? He had lost his pull; his lever failed him.
He could no longer pose, either to himself or to
anybody else, as the chivalrous reliever of distress,
the indignant friend to starving beauty. And Nina’s
gracious, though sadly unappreciated, bounty to a
fallen rival&mdash;that went by the board too.</p>

<p>These things were to the good; but at the back
of my mind there lurked a discontent, even a revolt.
Godfrey had proposed to buy Valdez; to
buy Lucinda from Valdez, he had meant. Now Arsenio
himself would buy her with his winning ticket,
coating the transaction with such veneer of romance
as might still lie in magic Twenty-one, thrice
repeated. One could trust him to make the most
of that, skillfully to eke it out to cover the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
as completely as possible. Would it be enough?
His hope lay in what that flush represented, the
memories it meant, that feeling in her which she
herself, long ago, had declared to be hers because
she was a primitive woman.</p>

<p>I did not, I fear, pay much attention to the
speeches&mdash;though I made one of them&mdash;at the farewell
dinner of our Conference that night; and next
day, my first free day, was still filled with the
thought of Arsenio and his three million francs;
my mind, vacant now of pressing preoccupations,
fell a prey to recollections, fancies, images. A restlessness
took possession of me; I could not stay in
Paris. I was entitled to a holiday; where should
I pass it? I did not want to go to Cragsfoot; I
had had enough of the Riviera. (There was possibly
a common element, ungallant towards a certain
lady and therefore not explicitly confessed to myself,
in my reluctance to turn my steps in either of
those directions.) Where should I go? Something
within me answered&mdash;Venice!</p>

<p>Why not? Always a pleasant place for a holiday
in times of peace; and one read that “peace
conditions” were returning; the pictures, and so on,
were returning too, or being dug up, or taken out
of their sandbags. And the place was reported to
be quite gay. Decidedly my holiday should be
passed at Venice.</p>

<p>Quite so! And a sporting gamble on my knowledge
of Arsenio, of his picturesque instinct, his eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
for a situation! As a minor attraction, there were
the needy aristocrats, his father’s old set, whom he
had been wont to “touch” in days of adversity; it
would be fine to flaunt his money in their eyes; they
would not sniff, Frost-like, at three million francs.
Here I felt even confident that he would speak
gracefully of repayment, though with care not to
wound Castilian pride by pressing the suggestion unduly.
But the great thing would be the association,
the memory, the two floors at the top of the <i>palazzo</i>.
Surely she would go there with him if she
would go anywhere? Surely there, if anywhere,
she would come back to him? That, beyond all
others, was the place to offer the pearl necklace, to
spread the carpet of bank notes. If the two were
to be found anywhere in the world together, it would
be at Venice, at the <i>palazzo</i>.</p>

<p>So to Venice I went&mdash;on an errand never defined
to myself, urged by an impulse, a curiosity, a longing,
to which many things in the past united to give
force, which the present position sharpened. “I
must know; I must see for myself.” That feeling,
which had made me unable to rest at Villa San
Carlo, now drove me to Venice. Putting money in
my pocket and giving my Paris bankers the name
of my hotel, I set out, on a road the end of which
I could not see, but which I was determined to tread,
if I could, and to explore.</p>

<p>In spite of my “facilities”&mdash;I had them again, and
certainly this time Lady Dundrannan, if she knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
my errand, would not have offered to secure them&mdash;my
journey was slow, and interrupted at one point
by a railway strike. When I arrived at my hotel
on the Grand Canal&mdash;Arsenio’s <i>palazzo</i> was just
round the corner by water, to be reached by land
through a short but tortuous network of alleys with
a little high stone bridge to finish up the approach
to its back door&mdash;a telegram had been waiting
forty-eight hours for me, forwarded from Cragsfoot
by way of Paris. In it Waldo told me of Aunt
Bertha’s death; influenza had swooped down on the
weakened old body, and after three days’ illness
made an end. It was hopeless to think of getting
back in time for the funeral; I could have done it
from Paris; I could not from Venice. I despatched
the proper reply, and went out to the Piazza. My
mind was for the moment switched off from what I
had come about; but I thought more about Sir Paget
than about poor old Aunt Bertha herself. He
would be very lonely. Would Briarmount allay his
loneliness?</p>

<p>It was about eleven o’clock on a bright sunny
morning. They were clearing away the protective
structures that had been erected round the buildings&mdash;St.
Mark’s, the Ducal Palace, the new Campanile.
I sat in a chair outside Florian’s and
watched. There on that fine morning the war
seemed somehow just a bad dream&mdash;or, rather, a
play that had been played and was finished; a tragedy
on which the curtain had fallen. See, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
were clearing away the properties, and turning to
real ordinary life again. So, for a space, it seemed
to a man seduced by beauty into forgetfulness.</p>

<p>They came and went, men, women and children,
all on their business and their recreations; there
were soldiers too in abundance, some draggled,
dirty, almost in rags, some tidy, trim and new, but
all with a subtle air of something finished, a job
done, comparative liberty at least secured; even the
prisoners&mdash;several gangs of them were marched by&mdash;had
that same air of release about them. Hawkers
plied their wares&mdash;women mostly, a few old
men and young boys; baskets were thrust under my
nose; I motioned them away impatiently. I had
traveled all night, and uncomfortably, with little
sleep. Here was peace; I wanted peace; I was
drowsy.</p>

<p>Thus, half as though in a dream, half as if it
were an answer to what my mood demanded,&mdash;beauty
back into the world, that was it&mdash;she came
across the Piazza towards the place where I sat.
Others sat there too&mdash;a row of them on my left
hand; I had taken a chair rather apart, at the end
of the row. She wore the little black frock&mdash;the
one she had worn at Ste. Maxime, the one Godfrey
had seen her in at Cimiez, or the fellow of it. On
her left arm hung an open basket; it was full of
fine needlework. I saw her take out the pieces, unfold
them, wave them in the air. She found customers;
distant echoes of chaff and chaffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
reached my ears. From chair to chair she passed,
coming nearer to me always.</p>

<p>I had upon me at this moment no surprise at seeing
her, no wonder why she, wife of the now opulent
Don Arsenio Valdez, was hawking fine needlework
on the Piazza. The speculation as to the state of
affairs, with which my mind had been so insatiably
busy, did not now occupy it. I was just boyishly
wrapped up in the anticipation of the joke that was
going to happen&mdash;that must happen unless&mdash;horrible
thought!&mdash;she sold out all her stock before she
got to me. But no! She smiled and joked, but she
stood out for her price. The basket would hold
out&mdash;surely it would!&mdash;As she came near, I turned
my head away&mdash;absorbed in the contemplation of
St. Mark’s&mdash;just of St. Mark’s!</p>

<p>I felt her by me before she spoke. Then I heard,
“Julius!” and a little gurgle of laughter. I turned
my head with an answering laugh; her eyes were
looking down at my face with their old misty
wonder.</p>

<p>“You here! I can’t sit down by you here. I’ll
walk across the Piazzetta, along to the quay. Follow
me in a minute. Don’t lose sight of me!”</p>

<p>“I don’t propose to do that,” I whispered back,
as she swung away from me. I paid my account,
and followed her some fifty yards behind. I did
not overtake her till we were at the Danieli Hotel.
“Where shall we go to talk?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Once or twice I’ve done good business on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Lido. There’s a boat just going to start. Shall we
go on board, Julius?”</p>

<p>I agreed eagerly and followed her on to the little
boat. She set me down in the bows, went off with
her basket, and presently came back without it.
“I’ve left it with the captain,” she explained; “he
knows me already, and will take care of it for me.
No more work to-day, since you’ve come! And
you must give me lunch, as you used to at Ste. Maxime.
Somewhere very humble, because I’m in my
working clothes.” She indicated the black frock,
and the black shawl which she wore over her fair
hair, after the fashion of the Venetian girls; I was
myself in an uncommonly shabby suit of pre-war
tweeds; we matched well enough so far as gentility
was concerned. I studied her face. It had grown
older, rather sharper in outline, though not lined
or worn. And it still preserved its serenity; she
still seemed to look out on this troublesome world,
with all its experiences and vicissitudes, from somewhere
else, from an inner sanctum in which she
dwelt and from which no one could wholly draw
her forth.</p>

<p>“How long have you been here?” I asked her,
as the little steamboat sped on its short passage
across to the Lido.</p>

<p>“Oh, about a fortnight or three weeks. I like
it, and I got work at once. I’d rather sew than sell,
but they sew so well here! And they tell me I sell
so well. So selling it mainly is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you came before the&mdash;the result of the
lottery?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve heard about the lottery, have you?
From Arsenio, or&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“No. I just saw it in the papers.”</p>

<p>The mention of the lottery seemed to afford her
fresh amusement, but she said nothing more about
it at the moment. “You see, I wanted to come away
from the Riviera&mdash;never mind why!”</p>

<p>“I believe I know why!”</p>

<p>“How can you? If you’ve not heard from Arsenio!”</p>

<p>“I’ve been in Paris&mdash;and there I saw Godfrey
Frost.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The exclamation was long drawn out;
it seemed to recognize that my having seen Godfrey
Frost might explain a good deal of knowledge on
my part. But she went on with her explanation.
“Since the air raids have stopped, Arsenio has managed
to let one floor of the <i>palazzo</i>&mdash;the <i>piano
nóbile</i>; and I suggested to him that I might come and
live on the top floor. I’d saved enough money for
the journey, and I pay Arsenio rent. I’m entirely
independent.”</p>

<p>“As you were at Ste. Maxime&mdash;and at Nice&mdash;or
Cimiez?”</p>

<p>“I believe you do know all about it!”</p>

<p>“Shall I mention a certain blue frock?”</p>

<p>She flushed&mdash;for her, quite brightly&mdash;and slowly
nodded her head. Then she sat silent till we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
reached the Lido, and had disembarked. Now she
seemed unwilling to talk more of her affairs; she
preferred to question me on mine. I told her of
Aunt Bertha’s death.</p>

<p>“Ah, she liked me once. Poor Sir Paget!” was
her only comment. “I think he likes you still,” I
suggested. She shook her head doubtfully, and insisted
on hearing about what I had been doing in
Paris.</p>

<p>It was not till after we had lunched and were
sitting drinking our coffee&mdash;just as in old days at
Ste. Maxime&mdash;that I brought her back to her own
affairs&mdash;to the present position.</p>

<p>“And you’re alone here&mdash;on the top floor of the
<i>palazzo</i>?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, smiling. “Alone&mdash;alone
on the top floor. I came here alone; we had had a
quarrel over&mdash;over what we’ll call the blue frock.
Arsenio promised not to follow me here unless I
gave him leave&mdash;which I told him I never should do.
‘Oh, yes, you will some day,’ he said; but he gave
me the promise. Oh, well, a promise from him!
What is it? Of course he’s broken it. He arrived
here the day before yesterday. He’s now at the
<i>palazzo</i>&mdash;on the floor below mine. It’s just like
Arsenio, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>She spoke of him with a sharper bitterness than
she had ever shown at Ste. Maxime, though the old
amusement at him was not entirely obscured by it.
Her tone made me&mdash;in spite of everything&mdash;feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
rather sorry for him.  The dream of his life&mdash;was
it to come only half true?  Was the half that had
come true to have no power to bring the other half
with it?  However little one might wish him success,
or he deserve it, one pang of pity for him was inevitable.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps he had some excuse,” I suggested.
“He was naturally&mdash;well, elated. That wonderful
piece of luck, you know!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” she murmured contemptuously&mdash;really
as if winning three million francs, on a million
to one chance or something like it, was nothing at all
to make a fuss about!  And that to a man who had
spent years of his life, and certainly sacrificed any
decency and self-respect that he possessed, in an apparently
insane effort to do it.</p>

<p>Her profile was turned to me now; she was looking
over the sands towards the Adriatic. I watched
her face as I went. “And he won on his favorite
number! On twenty-one, three times repeated!
That must have seemed to him&mdash;&mdash;” There was
no sign of emotion on her face. “Well, he called
it your number, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>She knew what I meant, and she turned to me.
But now she did not flush like a girl just out of the
schoolroom. There was no change of color, no
softening of her face such as the flush must have
brought with it.</p>

<p>“You’re speaking of a dead thing,” she told me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
a low calm voice. “Of a thing that is at last quite
dead.”</p>

<p>“It died hard, Lucinda.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it lived through a great deal; it lived long
enough&mdash;obstinately enough&mdash;to do sore wrong to&mdash;to
other people,&mdash;better people than either Arsenio
or me; long enough to make me do bad things&mdash;and
suffer them. But now it’s dead. He’s killed
it at last.”</p>

<p>At the moment I found nothing to say. Of
course I was glad&mdash;no use in denying that. Yet it
was grievous in its way. The thing was dead&mdash;the
thing that so long, through so much, had bound her
to Arsenio Valdez. The thing which had begun
with the kiss in the garden at Cragsfoot, years ago,
was finished.</p>

<p>“He put me to utter shame; he made me eat dirt,”
she whispered with a sudden note of passion in her
voice. She laid her arm on mine, and rose from her
chair. “It spoils my meeting with you to think of
it. Come back; I can do some work before it’s
dark, and you can go and see him&mdash;he’ll be at the
<i>palazzo</i>. There’s no reason you shouldn’t be
friends with him still.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know about that,” I observed cautiously.</p>

<p>“I’m willing enough to be friendly with him, for
that matter. But that’s&mdash;that’s not enough.
Come along, we shall just about catch a boat, I
think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>We began to walk along to the quay where we
were to embark.</p>

<p>“So he says he’s going to kill himself!” Lucinda
added with a scornful laugh.</p>

<p class="pch">VIEWS AND WHIMS</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">SUCH, then, was Lucinda’s state of mind with
regard to the matter. Her encounter with
Nina at Cimiez had opened her eyes; after
that, no evasions or lies from Arsenio could avail to
blind her. The keys of the fort had been sold behind
her back. The one thing that she had preserved
and cherished out of the wreck of her fortunes,
out of the sordid tragedy of her relations
with her husband, had been filched from her; her
proud and fastidious independence had been bartered;
Arsenio had sold it; Nina Dundrannan had
bought it. It was in effect that wearing of Nina’s
cast-off frocks which, long ago at Ste. Maxime, she
had pictured, with a smile, as an inconceivable emblem
of humiliation. Arsenio had brought her to
it, tricked her into it by his “presents” out of his
“winnings.”</p>

<p>A point of sentiment? Precisely&mdash;and entirely;
of a sentiment rooted deep in the nature of the two
women, and deep in the history of their lives, in the
rivalry and clash that there had been between them
and between their destinies. The affair of the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
frock (to sum up the offense under that nickname&mdash;there
had probably been other “presents”) might be
regarded as merely the climax of the indignities
which Arsenio had brought upon her&mdash;the proverbial
last straw. To her it was different in kind from all
the rest. In her <i>midinette’s</i> frock, in her Venetian
shawl, she could make or sell her needlework contentedly;
if on that score Nina felt exultation and
dealt out scorn, Nina was wrong; nay, Nina was
vulgar, and therefore a proper object for the
laughter which had amazed and impressed Godfrey
Frost. But she had been made Nina’s dependent,
the object of her triumphant contemptuous bounty.
That was iron entering her soul, a sharp point
piercing to the very heart of it. This deadly stroke
at her pride was fatal also to the last of her tenderness
for Arsenio. The old tie between them&mdash;once
so strong, so imperious, surviving so much&mdash;was
finally broken. She was willing to be friendly&mdash;if
friendliness can co-exist with undisguised resentment,
with a sense of outrage bitter as death itself.
But, in truth, how could it?</p>

<p>That same afternoon I made my way to the <i>palazzo</i>,
rather a gloomy, ruinous-looking old building, on
a narrow side canal, facing across it on to the heavy
blank bulk of a convent. This, then, was the scene
of “Venice,” of the old romance. To this they had
come back&mdash;not indeed quite in the manner that I
had imagined their return in my musings at Paris,
but still, I could not doubt, on his part at least with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
something of the idea and the impulse which my
fancy had attributed to him. How was he now
finding&mdash;and facing&mdash;the situation as it stood?</p>

<p>I climbed up the stone staircase&mdash;past the <i>piano
nóbile</i>, now let, as I had learnt, past another apartment
<i>al secondo</i>&mdash;to the third floor. There I
knocked. The door was opened by a small wizened
man, dressed in seedy black. He looked like a
waiter or a valet, run to seed. I asked for Valdez.
Yes, Monsieur was in, and would no doubt see Monsieur.
He himself was Monsieur Valdez’s servant&mdash;might
he take my hat and stick? He talked
while he did it; he had come with Monsieur from the
Riviera&mdash;from Nice; he had been&mdash;er&mdash;in the same
business establishment with Monsieur at Nice before&mdash;before
Monsieur’s great <i>coup</i>. In fact&mdash;here he
smiled proudly and detained me in the passage, laying
one grimy finger on my arm&mdash;Monsieur considered
him a mascot; it was from him that Monsieur
had purchased ticket 212,121. Imagine that!
“A pity you didn’t keep it!” said I. He just
shrugged his shoulders, a weary smile acquiescing in
that bit of bad luck. “However, Monsieur is very
good to me,” he ended as he&mdash;at last&mdash;opened an
inner door. Apparently Monsieur’s wonderful luck
gave him a sort of divinity in a fellow-gambler’s
eyes.</p>

<p>I found myself in a long narrow room, with three
windows facing on the canal and the convent. The
furniture was sparse, and looked old and rickety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
but it had the remains of elegance; only a small rug
or two mitigated the severity of the stone floor; one
could see by dirty marks where pictures had once
hung on the walls, but they hung there no more; altogether
a depressing apartment.</p>

<p>Arsenio Valdez was sitting at a big bureau between
two of the windows, with his back towards the
door. He turned round a dreary-looking face as he
heard my entrance. But the moment he saw who I
was, he sprang up and greeted me warmly, with evident
pleasure. He even held my hand while I accounted
for my presence as best I could. I had a
holiday, I thought that perhaps the change in his
fortunes would bring him back to Venice, and I
couldn’t resist the chance of congratulating him. I
tried to make a joke of the whole business, and ended
by squeezing his hand and felicitating him anew on
his magnificent luck. “It took my breath away
when I read it in the papers,” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I knew, I knew!” he declared, as he led
me to where a couple of armchairs were placed by
a small table in the third window, and made me sit
down. “It was a question of time, only of time.
If I could keep afloat, it was bound to come! That
was what nobody would believe. People are so
queer! And when Louis, that poor little chap who
showed you in, offered me the ticket&mdash;he worked at
that little den in Nice&mdash;when he offered me that
ticket&mdash;well, it was growing dark, and I had to spell
out the figures one by one&mdash;two one, two one, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
one! You see! There it was.  I was as certain as
if I had the prize in my pocket.  Hard luck on him?
No&mdash;he’d never have won with it&mdash;though the little
fool may think he would.  That number would
never have won except for me.  It was my number&mdash;and
again my number&mdash;and once again!”</p>

<p>He poured this out in a torrent of excited triumph,
every bit of him from top to toe full of movement
and animation.  It was a great vindication of himself,
of his faith, that he was putting before the
skeptic’s eyes.  He stood justified by it in all that he
had done and suffered, in all that he had asked
others to do and to endure.  He was more than
justified.  It was a glorification of him, Arsenio
Valdez, who had never doubted or faltered, who
had pursued Fortune for years, unwearied, undaunted.
He had caught her by the mantle at last.
<i>Voilà!</i> He ended with a last tumultuous waving of
both his hands.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re entitled to your crow, old chap,” I
said, “even if it doesn’t alter the fact that you were
a damned fool.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you never had any poetry, romance, imagination
in you!” he retorted, now with his old mocking
smile. “You haven’t got it, you Rillingtons&mdash;neither
you, nor yet Waldo.  That was why I&mdash;&mdash;”
He stopped, looking monkeyish.</p>

<p>“Why Twenty-one became your lucky number?
Exactly; I remember the day very well myself.  By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the way, I ought to tell you that I’ve already seen
Lucinda.”</p>

<p>He listened to a brief account of our meeting and
excursion in silence, seeming to watch my face
keenly. “You and she have always been very good
friends,” he remarked thoughtfully at the end. He
seemed to be considering&mdash;perhaps whether to take
me into his confidence, to consult me. I did not, of
course, feel entitled&mdash;or inclined!&mdash;to tell him of
the confidences that Lucinda had reposed in me.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” I observed, “beyond acquiring a
manservant&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Louis? Oh, well, I should have been a fool not
to keep him about me, shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Didn’t Roman Generals at their triumphs
carry a slave along, whose business it was to remind
them that they were mortal? If you look at the
unfortunate Louis from that point of view&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That fellow will bring me luck again,” he asserted
positively and seriously.</p>

<p>“Rot! What I was going to say was that you
don’t seem to have launched out much on the
strength of your three millions.” I cast a glance
round the faded room.</p>

<p>He jerked his head towards the big bureau at
which I had found him seated. “The money’s all
in there. I haven’t touched a penny of it. I
shan’t&mdash;just yet.” Again he was watching me; he
was, I think, wondering how much Lucinda had said
to me. “I’ve got a tenant for the first floor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
get along on the rent of that. And Lucinda&mdash;&mdash;”
He gave what may be called an experimental smile,
a silent “feeler”&mdash;&mdash;“Well, she persists in her
whim, as you’ve seen. Whatever may be said of it
down at Nice, it’s purely a whim now, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Whims are powerful things with women,” I remarked.
And platitudes are often useful conversational
refuges.</p>

<p>He sat frowning for a minute, with the weary
baffled air that his face had worn before he caught
sight of me. “Perhaps you don’t care for such a
short let, but, if it suits you, I’ll take the second
floor for a month certain,” I continued.</p>

<p>In an instant his face lit up. “You, Julius!
Why, that’s splendid! You’ll have to rough it a
bit; but Louis will look after you. He’s really very
good. Will you actually do it?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will&mdash;and glad to get it.”</p>

<p>“Well now, that is good!”</p>

<p>I knew that he was friendly towards me, but this
seemed an excess of pleasure. Besides, his face,
lately so weary and dreary, had assumed now the
monkey smile which I knew so well&mdash;the smile it
wore when he was “doing” somebody, getting the
better of somebody by one of his tricks. But whom
could he be doing now? Me? Lucinda? We two
seemed the only possible victims. That we were
victims&mdash;that we fitted into his plan&mdash;appeared
clear, later on. But it was a mistake to suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
we only were concerned. His next words enlightened
me as to that.</p>

<p>“I should be most delighted to have you for a
neighbor, under my roof, in any case. I’m sure you
know that. Oh, yes, I’m grateful to you. You
might have cut me! I know it. But you’ve taken
a broad view. You’ve allowed for the heart&mdash;though
not for the imagination, for the certainties
that lie beyond probability. Besides all that&mdash;which
I feel deeply&mdash;by taking that floor you relieve
me of a little difficulty.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it. How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Since I came here, I have naturally paid some
visits among my old friends. You smile! Oh, yes,
I’m human enough to like congratulations. Some of
them are people of rank, as you know&mdash;you used to
chaff me about my grandees! Their names appear
in the papers&mdash;those society paragraphs&mdash;the Paris
editions of American papers&mdash;Oh, my Lord! My
name appeared&mdash;an item&mdash;‘Don Arsenio Valdez has
returned to Palazzo Valdez!” He rose, went to
the big bureau, and came back with a telegram.
“Received to-day,” he added, as he put it into my
hands.</p>

<p>I read it, looked across at him, and laughed. It
was what I had expected; the only surprise was that
Godfrey had taken rather long to track them.
Scruples still obstinate, perhaps!</p>

<p>“So he wants to take an apartment in your
<i>palazzo</i>, does he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve been under some obligations to him; it
would be difficult to refuse. We’re good friends,
but&mdash;I didn’t want him here. It wouldn’t be&mdash;convenient.”
Now he was looking furtive and rather
embarrassed, as if he were uncertain how much
truth and how much lie he had better administer to
me.</p>

<p>“I saw him in Paris,” I remarked, “the other day,
and from what he said it seemed that he’d made very
good friends both with you and with your wife.”</p>

<p>He smiled; having no such shame as ordinary
mortals have, he accepted exposure easily. He relapsed
into the truth quite gracefully. “I don’t
know how the devil Lucinda feels about him,” he
confessed. “I wish he wouldn’t come at all, but I
can’t help that. At all events he needn’t be in the
house with us now!”</p>

<p>“Have you any reason to suppose she doesn’t like
him?” I asked.</p>

<p>His restlessness returned, and with it his dreary
look. He got up and began to wander about the
long room, fingering furniture and ornaments, then
drifting back to me at the window, and the next
moment away again. Suddenly, from the other end
of the room, he came out with, “What have they
told between them? Godfrey at Paris, and Lucinda
here to-day?”</p>

<p>“Well, pretty nearly everything, I fancy. If you
mean the money and Nina Dundrannan, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
forth. He described that meeting at Cimiez, for
example.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ve told you everything&mdash;everything
that matters. Well, what do you think?”</p>

<p>“If we’re to be friends, I’d sooner not offer an
opinion.”</p>

<p>He flashed out at me. “There’s your code&mdash;your
damned code! Didn’t I learn it in England?
Didn’t I have it literally drubbed into me&mdash;thrashed
into me&mdash;at school? And you keep it even when
you love a woman!”</p>

<p>“H’m! Not always in that case, I’m afraid, Arsenio.”</p>

<p>“If you ever do love a woman,” he went on contemptuously.
“For my part, I don’t believe any of
you know how!” He came to a stand before me.
“Why didn’t Waldo come after me and shoot me
through the head?”</p>

<p>“There was the greatest difficulty in stopping him,
I honestly assure you. But the war came, you
know, and it was his duty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“His duty! Oh, my Lord, his duty!” He positively
groaned at the point of view. “I give you my
word, if he had come after me, I would have never
returned his fire. I would have bared my breast&mdash;so!”
A rapid motion of his hands made as though
to tear the clothes from his chest; it was a very
dramatic gesture. “But when he didn’t come&mdash;pooh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was fighting for his country,” I suggested
mildly.</p>

<p>“And even you might have taken up the quarrel
with great propriety,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>“I apologize for not having shot you. Try not
to be such an ass, Arsenio.”</p>

<p>“You and he can sit down under such an affront
as I put on you and your family, and shelter yourselves
under duty. Duty! But up go your noses
and down go your lips when I, adoring the adorable,
milk a couple of vulgar millionaires of a few pounds
to make her happy, splendid, rich as she ought to be.
Yes, yes, about that you&mdash;offer no opinion! And
these people&mdash;my dupes, eh?”</p>

<p>“The word’s rather theatrical&mdash;as you’re being,
Arsenio. But let it pass.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, theatrical! I know! If a man doesn’t
love just like, and no more than, a bull, in England,
he’s theatrical. Well, what about my dupes? The
woman with her moneybags, meanly revengeful&mdash;Ah,
you give her up to me! You haven’t a word to
say, friend Julius! And the young man? Let us
forgive the good God for creating the young man!
He would buy my wife! Ah, would he? And buy
her cheap! All I’ve had of him would perhaps buy
her a fur coat! For the rest, he relied on his fascinations.
Cheaper than cash! I would have
cashed a million pounds and flung them at her feet!”</p>

<p>“But that’s just as vulgar,” I protested, rather
weakly. I was a little carried away by Arsenio’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
eloquence; it was at least a point of view which I
had not sufficiently considered.</p>

<p>“Not from him! It would be giving what he
loves best!” He laughed in a bitter triumph, then
suddenly flung himself down into his chair again.
“I had ten louis left&mdash;five of hers, five of his. With
hers I bought the ticket; on his I starved till the
draw came. Am I not revenged on the woman who
would humiliate my wife, on the man who would
buy the honor of Donna Lucinda Valdez?”</p>

<p>“It’s about the oddest kind of revenge I ever
heard of,” was all I found to say. “You’ll complete
it, I suppose, by dazzling Godfrey, when he arrives,
with the spectacle of Luanda’s virtuous
splendor? Or is he to find her still selling needlework
on the Piazza?”</p>

<p>He leant across the little table and laid his hand
on my arm. I imagined that it must be the table at
which Lucinda had once sat, mending her gloves&mdash;most
skillfully no doubt, for had she not proved herself
a fine needlewoman?</p>

<p>“You too are against me?” he asked in a low
voice. “Bitterly against me, Julius?”</p>

<p>“Once you took her&mdash;yes, here. Then you forsook
her. Then you took her again. And you’ve
dragged her in the dirt.”</p>

<p>“But now I can&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“That to her would be dirt too,” I said. “I suppose
she won’t touch that money? That’s why she’s
still peddling her wares on the Piazza?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>He made a despairing gesture of assent with his
hands&mdash;despairing, uncomprehending. Then he
raised his head and said proudly, “But if she doesn’t
yet understand, I shall make her!” Then, with a
sudden change of manner, he added, “And you’ll
move into the floor below to-morrow? That’s
capital! You might ask us both to dinner&mdash;give a
housewarming! Louis will look after your marketing
and cooking.”</p>

<p>“With the greatest of pleasure,” I agreed, but
with some surprise. It would have seemed more
natural in him to invite me on the first night.</p>

<p>He saw my surprise; what didn’t he see when he
exercised his wits?</p>

<p>“It must be that way; because she never comes
into my apartment,” he said, but now quietly, cheerfully,
as if he were mentioning another of those
whims which are so powerful with women.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pch">LIVING FUNNILY</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE “housewarming” so adroitly suggested
by Arsenio duly took place; it was followed
by other meetings of the same kind. Louis
had evidently received his instructions; every evening
at half-past seven he laid dinner for three in my
<i>salon</i>; and this without any apology or explanation.
When his table was spread, he would say, “I will inform
Madame and Monsieur that dinner is served.”
Presently Madame and Monsieur would arrive&mdash;separately;
Madame first (I think Arsenio listened
until he heard her step passing his landing), Monsieur
completing the party. I played host&mdash;rather
ostentatiously; there had to be no mistake as to who
was the host; and every morning I gave Louis
money for the marketing.</p>

<p>Except for this evening meeting, we three saw
little of one another. Arsenio was either out or
shut up in his own apartment all day; Lucinda went
punctually to her work in the morning and did not
return till six o’clock; I did the sights, went sailing
sometimes, or just mooned about; I met Lucinda
now and then, but beyond a nod and a smile she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
took no notice of me; there were no more excursions
to the Lido. Perhaps the claims of business did not
permit them to her; perhaps she thought them unnecessary,
in view of our opportunities for conversation
in the evening.</p>

<p>For we had many. Arsenio’s views on the position
in which he found himself had appeared pretty
clearly from what he had said. By an incomprehensible
perversity&mdash;of fate, of woman, of English
temperament and morals&mdash;his grand <i>coup</i> had
proved a failure; he would not accept that failure as
final, but neither for the moment could he alter it.
He always seemed to himself on the brink of success;
every day he was tantalized by a fresh rebuff.
She was friendly, but icily cold and, beyond doubt,
subtly, within herself, ridiculing him. The result
was that, in the old phrase, he could live neither
with her nor without her. The daily meeting which
he had engineered, with my aid (and at my expense),
was a daily disappointment; his temper could endure
only a certain amount of her society in the mood in
which she presented herself to him. After that,
his patience gave; he probably felt that his self-control
would. So always, soon after our meal was
finished, he would go off on some pretext or another;
sometimes we heard him above in his own
apartment, walking about restlessly; sometimes we
heard him go downstairs past my landing&mdash;out
somewhere. He seldom came back before ten
o’clock; and his return was always the signal for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Lucinda to retire to her own quarters at the top of
the house.</p>

<p>During his absence she and I sat together, talking
or in silence, I smoking, she sewing; if the evening
was fine and warm, we sat in the armchairs by the
little table in the window; if the weather was chilly&mdash;and
in that dingy stone-floored room it was apt to
seem chillier than it was&mdash;Louis made us a little fire
of chips and logs, and we sat close by it. The old
fleeting intimacy of Ste. Maxime renewed itself between
us. After five or six evenings spent in this
fashion, it almost seemed as though Arsenio were
a visitor who came and went, while she and I belonged
to the establishment.</p>

<p>“The atmosphere’s quite domestic,” I said to her
with a smile. It was cold that night; we were close
by the fire; her fingers were busy with her work
under the light of the one lamp which showed up
her face in clear outline&mdash;just as it had been defined
against the gloom of the dark <i>salle-à-manger</i> at Ste.
Maxime.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, you’re a restful sort of person to
be with,” she answered, smiling, but not looking up,
and going on with her sewing.</p>

<p>We had not talked much more about her affairs,
or Arsenio’s. She seemed to think that enough had
been said as to those, on the Lido; her conversation
had been mostly on general matters, though she also
took pleasure in describing to me the incidents and
humors of her business hours, both here at Venice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and in the past at Ste. Maxime and Nice. To-night
I felt impelled to get a little nearer to her secret
thoughts again.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t Waldo restful&mdash;barring an occasional
storm?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but then&mdash;as I’ve told you&mdash;at that time I
wasn’t. Never for an hour really. Now I am.
I should be quite content to go on just as we are forever.”
She looked up and gave me a smile. “I include
you in ‘we’, Julius. You give me a sense of
safety.”</p>

<p>“You can’t sell needlework on the Piazza all your
life,” I expostulated.</p>

<p>“Really I could quite happily, if only I were let
alone&mdash;otherwise. But I shan’t be, of course. Arsenio
will get tired of his present tactics soon&mdash;the
ones he’s followed since you came. We shall either
go back to storms and heroics again, or he’ll discover
something else. Just now he’s trying the patient,
the pathetic! But he won’t stick to that long. It’s
not in his nature.”</p>

<p>How calmly now she analyzed and dissected him!
With amusement still mingled with her scorn, but&mdash;it
must be repeated&mdash;with the old proportions terribly
reversed. It cannot be denied that there was
something cruel in the relentless vision of him which
she had now achieved.</p>

<p>“He’ll try something spectacular next, I expect,”
she pursued, delicately biting off a thread.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean&mdash;what you referred to on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Lido?” I asked, raising my brows and passing my
hand across my jugular vein.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! That would be something real. His
will be a performance of some sort. It’s ten days
since he poured all his bank notes on the table before
me, and swore he’d burn them and kill himself if I
didn’t pick them up. Of course he hasn’t done
either! He’s locked them up again, and he’s trying
to get you to persuade me to see reason&mdash;in the way
he sees it!”</p>

<p>“But I’ve told him that&mdash;I’ve told what I think of
him&mdash;or as good as!”</p>

<p>“Well, as soon as he’s convinced this plan won’t
work, he’ll try another. You’ll see!” She smiled
again. “I shouldn’t wonder if the arrival of Godfrey
Frost were to produce some manifestation,
some change in his campaign.”</p>

<p>It was almost the first&mdash;I am not sure that it was
not absolutely the first&mdash;time that she had referred
to Godfrey. Though I felt considerable curiosity
about her feelings with regard to that young man, I
had forborne to question her. Whatever he might
be in himself, he was friend, partner, kinsman to
Nina Dundrannan. The subject might not be
agreeable.</p>

<p>“What’s that young man coming here for?” I
asked.</p>

<p>Something in my tone evidently amused her. She
laid her work down beside her, drew her chair nearer
the fire, and stretched out her legs towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
blaze. She was thoughtful as well as amused, questioning
herself as well as talking to me; it was quite
in her old fashion.</p>

<p>“I liked him; he amused me&mdash;and it amused me.
He’s Nina, isn’t he? Nina writ large and clumsily?
What she is delicately, he is coarsely. Oh,
well, that’s rather a hard word, perhaps. I mean,
obviously, insistently. Where she carries an atmosphere,
he works an air pump. Still I liked him;
he was kind to me; he gave me treats&mdash;as you did.
And it was fun poaching on Nina’s preserves. After
all, she didn’t have it all her own way when we met at
Cimiez!”</p>

<p>“She’s not having it now, I should imagine&mdash;since
he’s coming to Venice.”</p>

<p>“I like treats, and I like being admired, and I
liked the poaching,” Lucinda pursued. “He gave
me all that. And he really was generously indignant
at my having to earn an honest living&mdash;no,
having to earn a poor living, I mean.”</p>

<p>“He gave Arsenio money too, didn’t he?” Of
course I knew the answer, but I had my reason for
putting the question.</p>

<p>“Yes; I didn’t know it, but I suspected it&mdash;or Arsenio
wouldn’t have been so accommodating to him.
But he really wanted to help me, to make things
easier for me. That wasn’t her motive!”</p>

<p>Remembering what I did of Lady Dundrannan’s
attitude and demeanor during my stay at Villa San
Carlo, I did not feel equal to arguing that it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“So&mdash;altogether&mdash;I let him flirt with me a good
deal. I don’t think you know much about flirtation,
do you, Julius? Oh, I don’t mean love!
Well, it’s a series of advances and retreats, you see.”
(She entered on this exposition with a feigned and
hollow gravity.) “When the man advances, the
woman retreats. But if the man retreats, the
woman advances. And so it goes on. Do you at
all see, Julius?”</p>

<p>“I’m disposed to believe that you’re giving me a
practical demonstration&mdash;of the advance!”</p>

<p>She laughed gaily. “Pure theory&mdash;for the moment,
at all events! But he didn’t always advance
at the proper moment. Never you dare to tell Nina
that! But he didn’t. I’m not a vain woman, am I,
or I shouldn’t tell even you! Something always
seemed to bring him up short. Fear of Nina, do
you think? Or was he too big a man? Or had he
scruples?”</p>

<p>“A bit of all three, perhaps.” I had had the
benefit of another version of this story&mdash;at Paris.</p>

<p>“Anyhow he never did, or suggested, anything
very desperate. And so&mdash;I’m rather wondering
what’s bringing him to Venice. Because now we’re
rich&mdash;we have at least a competence. We’re respectable.
Monsieur Valdez can afford to be
honest; Madame Valdez can afford to keep straight.
Desperation might have had its chance at Nice.
Oh, yes, it might easily! It hasn’t surely got half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
such a good chance now? I mean, it couldn’t seem
to have&mdash;to Godfrey Frost.”</p>

<p>“I’m not quite sure about that. He saw the
famous meeting at Cimiez. He’s told me about it&mdash;I
told you I’d seen him since, didn’t I? I fancy
he understands your feelings better than you think.
He has a good brain and&mdash;plenty of curiosity.”</p>

<p>“Then if he does understand&mdash;and still comes to
Venice&mdash;&mdash;?” She looked at me with her brows
raised and a smile on her lips. “Looks serious,
doesn’t it?” she ended. She broke into low
laughter. “It would be such glorious fun to become
Mrs. Godfrey Frost!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a husband still, remember!”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing&mdash;now. Or do you set up Arsenio
as morality?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! If Arsenio’s morality, why, damn
morality!” I said.</p>

<p>“And there’s just the piquant touch of uncertainty
as to whether I could do it&mdash;whether I could become
even so much as an unofficial Mrs. Godfrey&mdash;whom
Nina didn’t know, but whom she’d think about!
Still&mdash;he is coming to Venice. It’s rather tempting,
isn’t it, Julius?”</p>

<p>“Does a revenge on Arsenio come into it at all?”</p>

<p>Her smile disappeared, her face suddenly grew
sad. “Oh, no, I’m having that already. I don’t
want to have&mdash;not as revenge&mdash;but I can’t help it.
It is so with me&mdash;no credit to me, either.”</p>

<p>“All the same, Arsenio isn’t pleased at our friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
coming to Venice. He was very glad when I took
this apartment&mdash;mainly because then Godfrey
couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t come, and he had&mdash;I wonder!”</p>

<p>“Do you care for him in the very least?” I asked,
perhaps rather hotly.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered with cool carelessness.
“But is that the question?” She dropped out of her
chair on to her knees before the fire, holding out her
hands to warm them. Her face, pale under the
lamp, was ruddy in the blaze of the logs. “You’re
a silly old idealist, Julius. You idealize even me&mdash;me,
who did, in this very place, what shouldn’t be
done&mdash;me who ran away from a good marriage and
a better man&mdash;me who have knocked about anyhow
for years&mdash;knowing I was always on sale&mdash;I’m on
sale every afternoon on the Piazza&mdash;if only I chose
to make the bargain. But you choose to see me as
I was once.” She laughed gently. “Well, I think
you’ve saved my life&mdash;or my reason&mdash;twice&mdash;here
and at Ste. Maxime&mdash;so I suppose I must put up
with you!”</p>

<p>“You’ll never go to a man unless you love him,”
I said obstinately.</p>

<p>Suddenly she flung her hands high above her head.
“Oh, what does one keep in this wicked world, what
does one keep?”</p>

<p>Her hands sank down on to her knees&mdash;as though
their reluctant fall pictured the downward drag of
the world on the spirit. In that posture she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
crouched many minutes without moving; and I, not
stirring either, watched her.</p>

<p>“I had my one virtue,” she said at last. “My
primitive virtue. I was faithful to my man&mdash;even
when I tried not to be, still I was. Now I’ve lost
even that. It wouldn’t cost me an hour’s sleep to
deceive or desert Arsenio. I should, in fact, rather
enjoy it, just for its own sake.”</p>

<p>“I daresay. But you’re not for sale&mdash;in marriage
or out of it. And, as you said, isn’t your revenge
complete?”</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of revenge; is it ever, in the
end, really complete?” She turned round on me
suddenly and laid a hand on my knee. “Yes&mdash;that’s
what has been in my mind. But it’s only just
this minute that I’ve seen it. I daresay you’ve seen
it, though, haven’t you? I’m becoming cruel; I’m
beginning to enjoy tormenting him. I’ve read
somewhere that people who have to punish do sometimes
get like that, even when it’s a just punishment.
But it’s rather an awful idea.”</p>

<p>Her face was full of a horrified surprise. “I do
get things out so, in talking to you,” she added in
a hurried murmur. “Oh, not words; thoughts, I
mean. You let me go on talking, and I straighten
myself out before my own eyes. You know? Till
now, I’ve never seen what I was coming down to.
Poor old Arsenio! After all, he’s not a snake or a
toad, is he?” She laughed tremulously. “Though
why should one be cruel even to toads and snakes?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
One just leaves them alone. That’s what I must do
with Arsenio.”</p>

<p>“An illogical conclusion&mdash;since he isn’t snake or
toad,” I said, as lightly as I could.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know! That’s it! Yes, I’ve been
saying that I was very just, and fine, and all that!
And I’ve really been enjoying it! Julius dear, has
my honest work been all just viciousness&mdash;cattiness,
you know?”</p>

<p>“God bless you, no! Why do you round on
yourself like this? You’ve come through the whole
thing splendidly. Oh, you’re human! There’s
Nina, and all that, of course. But it’s nonsense to
twist the whole thing like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” she decided&mdash;this time quickly, even
abruptly. “It hasn’t been that&mdash;not most of it anyhow.
But it’s in danger of being it now. It almost
is it, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, at dinner, I’ve thought you a little
cruel.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I have been.” She rose to her feet almost
with a jump. “If I have to go&mdash;to rescue myself
from that&mdash;will you help me, Julius? Because I’ve
no money to go far&mdash;to take myself out of his
reach.”</p>

<p>As&mdash;on this question&mdash;we stood opposite to one
another, she just murmuring “Yes, that’s it,” I nonplussed
at her question, at the whole turn her talk
had taken&mdash;we heard the tramp of steps on the stone
staircase. She flung me a glance; more than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
person was coming up. “It’s just like Arsenio not
to have told us!” she whispered with a smile.</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;&mdash;?” I whispered back.</p>

<p>“He’s been to meet him at the station, of course!
Julius, how shall I behave?”</p>

<p>We heard the door of the apartment opened.
The next moment Arsenio opened the door of the
room, and ushered in Godfrey Frost, in a big fur
coat, fresh from the train evidently.</p>

<p>“Here he is!” Arsenio cried, almost triumphantly.</p>

<p>Godfrey stood on the threshold, obviously taken
aback. It was clear that Arsenio had not told him
that he was to meet the pair of us.</p>

<p>Arsenio wore his most characteristic grin. I
could not help smiling at it. Lucinda laughed openly.
Godfrey, caught unawares as he was, carried
the position off bravely.</p>

<p>“Delightful to see you both! But where am I?
Whose charming room is this?”</p>

<p>“It’s the devil and all to know that! We live so
funnily,” said Monkey Valdez.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pch">PARTIE CARRÉE</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN I awoke the next morning, it was
with the memory of one of the queerest
hours that I had ever spent in my life.
After I had drunk my coffee, I lay late in bed, reviewing
it, smiling over Arsenio’s malicious gayety,
over Godfrey’s surly puzzlement, over myself
struggling between amusement and disgust, over Lucinda’s
delicate aloofness and assumed unconsciousness
of anything peculiar in the situation.</p>

<p>For the devil and all&mdash;to use his own phrase&mdash;took
possession of Monkey Valdez. Lucinda was
not the only one to whom the infliction of pain and
punishment might become a joy. Arsenio had been
powerless to prevent Godfrey from coming to Venice;
he meant to make him pay for having come; to
make him pay, I suppose, for having sought to take
advantage of Arsenio’s need, for having dared to
think that he could buy Lucinda&mdash;from a husband
who all but told him that he was willing to sell her!
Great crimes in the eyes of Arsenio, now no more
in need, now grown rich, yet with his riches turned
to useless dross, because of him, and of them, Lucinda
would have nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>He could not pose as the happy husband. That
would not be plausible; Lucinda would not second it,
and Godfrey knew too much. But by every means
within the range of his wonderful and impish ingenuity,
by insinuation and innuendo, by glances,
smiles, and gestures, he pointed Godfrey to the inference
that I was the favored man, the aspiring,
perhaps already the successful, lover. In that Godfrey
was to find the explanation of the “funny” way
in which we lived&mdash;an apartment for each of us,
husband and wife meeting only at my board, her
cool defensive demeanor towards him, my friendly
toleration of his presence, which I must dislike, but
also must endure because it was a cover and a screen.
None of this, of course, in words, but all acted&mdash;admirably
acted, so that it was equally impossible
for Godfrey not to accept it, and for either Lucinda
or myself to repudiate it. Had we tried, he would
have made us appear ridiculous; there was not a definite
word on which we could fasten, not a peg on
which to hang the denial.</p>

<p>Lucinda did not want to deny, to judge by her demeanor;
but neither did she do anything or show any
signs that could be construed into an admission. She
behaved just as a woman of the world would behave
in such a situation&mdash;with a husband so unreasonable,
so ill-bred as to let his jealousy appear in the
presence of an outsider! To see nothing of what he
meant, not to consider it possible that he could mean
it&mdash;that would be the woman of the world’s cue;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
it was perfectly taken up in Lucinda’s cool and remote
self-possession, the aloofness of her eyes as she
listened to Arsenio, her easy cordiality towards both
myself and Godfrey, her absolute ignoring of the
“funniness” of our way of living. No, she did not
want to deny, any more than she meant actively to
aid, the impression. It was Arsenio’s game&mdash;let
him play it. If to behave naturally tended to
strengthen it, that was not her fault. Meanwhile
she enjoyed the comedy; not a single direct glance
at me told that&mdash;only an occasional faint smile at
Arsenio’s adroitest touches.</p>

<p>She might be pardoned for enjoying the comedy;
it was good. Perhaps for not sharing the distaste
that mingled with my own appreciation&mdash;for not
feeling the disgust that I felt at this cheapening of
her. In her eyes Arsenio had already cheapened
her to the uttermost; he could do nothing more in
that direction. He could still give her pleasure&mdash;of
a kind; by suffering cruelty himself, as it seemed, or
by being cleverly cruel to others. He could no
longer give her pain; he had exhausted his power to
do that.</p>

<p>He knew what he could do and what he could not.
If she was a character in his comedy, she was his
audience too. He played to her for all he was
worth; he saw the occasional smile and understood
it as well as I did. His eyes sought for any faint
indications of her applause.</p>

<p>And the victim? As I said, he carried off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
meeting well at first; the Frost composure stood him
in good stead; he was not readily to be shaken out
of it. But at last, under Arsenio’s swift succession
of pricks, he grew sullen and restive. His puzzled
ill-humor vented itself on me, not on his dexterous
tormentor.</p>

<p>“When did you make up your mind to come here?
You said nothing about anything of the sort in
Paris!”</p>

<p>The half-smothered resentment in his tone accused
me of treachery&mdash;of having stolen a march on
him. Arsenio smiled impishly as he listened&mdash;himself
at last silent for a minute.</p>

<p>“The news of our friends’ good fortune encouraged
me to join them,” I said. It was true&mdash;roughly;
and I was very far from acknowledging any
treachery.</p>

<p>This was the first reference that any one had made
to the grand <i>coup</i>&mdash;to the winning ticket&mdash;a reticence
which had, no doubt, increased Godfrey’s
puzzle. He could not put questions himself, but I
had seen him eyeing Lucinda’s black frock; Arsenio
too was uncommonly shabby; and, as the latter had
incidentally mentioned, I was paying rent: “I can’t
afford not to charge it,” he had added with a rueful
air, ostentatiously skirting the topic. Now he took
it up, quite artificially. “Ah, that bit of luck! Oh,
all to the good! It settles our future&mdash;doesn’t it,
Lucinda?” (Here came one of her rare faint
smiles.) “But we’re simple folk with simple tastes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
We haven’t substantially altered our mode of living.
Lucinda has her work&mdash;she likes it. I stick on in
the old ancestral garrets.” (“Ancestral” was
stretching things a bit&mdash;his father had bought the
<i>palazzo</i>, and re-christened it.) “But we shall find
a use for that windfall yet. Still, now you’ve come,
we really must launch out a bit. Julius is one of the
family&mdash;almost; but you’re an honored guest.
Mustn’t we launch out a little, Lucinda?”</p>

<p>“Do as you like. It’s your money,” she answered.
“At least, what you don’t owe of it is.”</p>

<p>Then, at that, for a sudden short moment, the
real man broke through. “Then none of it’s mine,
because I owe it all to you,” he said. The words
might have been a continuation of his mockery; they
would have borne that construction. But they were
not; his voice shook a little; his mind was back on
Number Twenty-one and what that meant&mdash;or had
meant&mdash;to him. But he recovered his chosen tone
in an instant. “And behold her generosity! She
gives it back to me&mdash;she won’t touch a penny of it!”</p>

<p>At that a sudden gleam of intelligence shot into
Godfrey’s eyes. He fixed them inquiringly on Lucinda.
She was in great looks that evening&mdash;in her
plain, close-fitting, black frock, with never an ornament
save a single scarlet flower in her fair hair;
he might well look at her; but it was not her beauty
that drew his gaze at that moment. He was questioning
more than admiring. She gave him back his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
look steadily, smiling a little, ready to let him make
what he could of her husband’s exclamation.</p>

<p>“Let me give one dinner party out of it,” implored
Arsenio. “Just we four&mdash;a perfect <i>partie
carrée</i>. If I do, will you come to it, Lucinda?”</p>

<p>She gave him an amused little nod; he had
touched her humor. “Yes, if you give Mr. Frost a
dinner, I’ll come,” she said. “What day?”</p>

<p>“Why, the first on which we can eat a dinner!
And that’s to-morrow! Upstairs&mdash;in my apartment?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;here&mdash;if Julius will let us,” she said mildly,
but very firmly. “You accept, Mr. Frost? And
we’ll all dress up and be smart,&mdash;to honor Mr.
Frost, and Arsenio’s banquet.”</p>

<p>So the arrangement was made, and it promised, to
my thinking, as I lay in bed, another queer evening.
Somebody, surely, would break the thin ice on which
Arsenio was cutting his capers! What if we all
began to speak our true thoughts about one another?
But the evening that I was recalling held still something
more in it&mdash;the most vivid of all its impressions,
although the whole of it was vivid enough in
my memory.</p>

<p>Godfrey rose to take his leave. “Till to-morrow,
then!” he said, as he took Lucinda’s hand, bowing
slightly over it; he pressed it, I think, for her fingers
stiffened and she frowned&mdash;Arsenio standing by,
smiling.</p>

<p>“See him down the stairs, Arsenio,” she ordered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
“The light’s very dim, and two or three of the steps
are broken.”</p>

<p>The two went out! I heard Arsenio’s voice chattering
away in the distance as they went down the
high steep stairs. Lucinda stood where she was for
a minute, and then came across to the chair on which
I had sat down, after saying good-night to Godfrey.
She dropped on her knees beside it, laying her arms
across my knees, and looking up at me with eyes
full of tears.</p>

<p>“I do pity him,” she murmured, “I do! And I’d
be kind to him. I don’t want him to go on being as
bitter and unhappy as he is&mdash;oh, you saw! One can’t
help being amused, but every time he hit Godfrey,
he hit himself too&mdash;and harder. But what’s the
use? Nothing’s any use except the thing that I
can’t do!”</p>

<p>I laid my hand on hers&mdash;they lay side by side on
my knee. “It’s rather a case of ‘God help us all!’ I
think.”</p>

<p>“You too?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;when you’re unhappy.”</p>

<p>I felt her hands rise under my hand, and I released
them. She took mine between hers and
raised it to her lips. Then a silence fell between us,
until I became conscious that Arsenio was standing
on the threshold, holding the knob of the opened
door. He had stolen back with the quietness of a
cat; we had neither of us heard a sound of him.</p>

<p>Lucinda saw him, and slowly rose to her feet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
she was without a trace of embarrassment.  She
walked across to the door; he held it wide open for
her to pass&mdash;she always went upstairs alone&mdash;But
to-night&mdash;against the custom of their nightly parting
during the last week&mdash;she stopped and took his
hand.  Her back was towards me now; I could not
see her eyes, but there must have been an invitation
in them, for he slowly advanced his head towards
hers.  She did not need to stoop&mdash;she was as tall as
he was. She kissed him on the forehead.</p>

<p>“If you will be content with peace, peace let it
be,” she said.</p>

<p>He made no motion to return the kiss&mdash;the invitation
could not have carried so far as that; he
stood quite still while she passed out and while her
footsteps sounded on the stairs.</p>

<p>There came the noise of a door opening and shutting,
up above us, on the top floor.  He shut the
door that he had been still holding, and came slowly
up to the hearthrug, by which I sat.</p>

<p>I lit a cigarette.  All the while that it took me to
smoke it he stood there in silence, with his hands in
the pockets of his jacket.  His impishness had
dropped from him, exorcised, as it seemed, by
Lucinda’s kiss.  His face was calm and quiet.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s finished!” he said at last, more to
himself than to me.  I did not speak; he looked
down at me and addressed me more directly.  “You
saw her?  You saw what she meant by that?  It
was&mdash;good-by!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid I think so too, old friend&mdash;especially
in view of what she’d just been saying to me. She’s
greatly distressed about it, but&mdash;&mdash;” At that moment
I myself was greatly distressed for him, indeed
for both of them; but the next he spoilt my feeling
(so to say) as far as he was concerned, and made
Lucinda’s distress look overdone, or even gratuitous.
He drew himself up pompously and spread his arms
out on either side of him, holding his hands palms
uppermost, rather as if he were expounding an
argument to a public meeting.</p>

<p>“Very well! I accept. Whatever her future
feelings may be, I take her at her word, and accept&mdash;once
and for all! It is not consonant with my
dignity, my self-respect&mdash;&mdash;” I sighed. He gave
me a short, sharp look, but then went on in just the
same fashion&mdash;“to prolong this situation, to persecute,
to trouble. I will relieve her of my presence,
of the thought of me. She is still young&mdash;almost a
girl. She will find another life to live. She will
find love again&mdash;though not the love I gave her.
And if ever she thinks of Arsenio Valdez, let it be
with charity and forgiveness!”</p>

<p>It seemed rather cruel to recognize the fact,&mdash;but
a fact it obstinately and obviously was&mdash;that
Lucinda’s future thinking of him formed part of the
program; relieving her of the thought of him was
a mere flourish; whatever he proposed to do with
himself, he did not propose to do that.</p>

<p>“Time softens bitter memories, the mind dwells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
on what is sweet in the past. So may it be with her,
when I am gone, Julius!”</p>

<p>“Where do you propose to go?’” I asked irritably.
His pomposity and sentimentality seemed to
me transpontine. The man could not be sincere
for five minutes; he was cutting a figure again.</p>

<p>“Ah! that, my friend, need not be put in words.
There is one course always open to a gentleman who
has staked his all and lost.”</p>

<p>It occurred to me that Arsenio had very often
staked his all and lost, and that his course had been
to borrow some more from other people. But what
was the good of saying that to him when he was on
his high horse&mdash;a very prancing steed? In a different
mood, though, he would have laughed at the reminder
himself.</p>

<p>Of course I knew what he meant me to understand.
But, frankly, I did not at the time believe a
word of it; and now, as I lay thinking it over, I believed
in it even less, if possible. I took it for
another flourish, and smiled to myself at it, as Lucinda
had laughed at the threat when she mentioned
it to me on the Lido.</p>

<p>“Sleep on it, old fellow,” I advised him. “You’ll
feel better about it, perhaps, in the morning. If
you so decide to give her a separation or a divorce,
it can all be arranged in a friendly way. She wants
to be as kind and friendly as she can to you.”</p>

<p>“As I say, I trust that her memory of me will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
that,” he said in his most solemn sepulchral voice.
“And you, my friend, you too&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, damn it all, let my memories of you alone,
Arsenio! I assure you that talking this sort of
stuff won’t improve them.” I got up from my chair.
“Go to bed now&mdash;think it over to-morrow. At any
rate, you’ve got your dinner to-morrow evening; you
can’t do anything till after that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed thoughtfully. “Yes, I’ve got
my dinner to-morrow.” He seemed to meditate on
the prospect with a gloomy satisfaction. I meditated
on the same prospect now with considerable
apprehension. He had finally left me the night before
still in his tragic vein, still on his high horse.
But who in the world could tell in what mood this
evening would find him? On whom might he not
turn? What outrage on the social decencies might
he not commit? Last night we had been presented
with an extensive selection from his <i>répertoire</i>,
ranging from schoolboy naughtiness to the <i>beau
geste</i>&mdash;the insufferable <i>beau geste</i>&mdash;of a romantically
contemplated suicide. What might we not be
treated to to-night? And I did not feel at all sure
how much Lucinda could stand&mdash;or how much Godfrey
Frost would.</p>

<p>With a knock at the door, Louis came in, in his
usual sleek and deferential fashion. He laid a
little bundle of letters on the table by the bed, and
inquired whether Monsieur would take <i>déjeuner</i> at
home to-day&mdash;or would he perhaps prefer to go out?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
It was obvious, from the way the question was put,
which Louis himself preferred. And the next moment
he murmured the humble suggestion that there
were the preparations, for dinner to-night, of
course.</p>

<p>“Are there? Special preparations, do you mean,
Louis?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Valdez is, I understand, with your
permission, Monsieur, intending to provide a few
decorations for the <i>salon</i>. He tells me that he entertains
to-night in honor of the arrival of his friend
Monsieur Frost.” (Froost, he called it).</p>

<p>“Oh, all right! I’ll certainly lunch out, if it
makes things easier for you, Louis.”</p>

<p>When he was gone, I opened my letters. Among
them was one from Waldo, and another from Sir
Paget, both of some length, touching the family arrangement
which Waldo had suggested with regard
to Cragsfoot. I decided to put them in my pocket
and read them later&mdash;while I had my lunch. I had
lain already overlong in bed, my thoughts busy with
the events of the <i>partie carrée</i> of last night.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">SUITABLE SURROUNDINGS</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">WALDO’S was a business letter; any feelings
that might be influencing the proposed
transaction, any sentiment that
might be involved&mdash;whether of Nina’s, of his own,
of his father’s, or of mine&mdash;he appeared to consider
as having been adequately indicated in our talk at
Paris, and accorded them only one passing reference.
He assumed that I should be bearing all that&mdash;he
had a habit of describing the emotions as “all that,”
I remembered&mdash;in mind; what remained was to ask
me whether I were favorably disposed to the arrangement,
the value of his remainder&mdash;which must,
alas, before many years were out, become an estate
in possession&mdash;to be fixed by a firm of land agents
selected by himself and me&mdash;“from which price I
should suggest deducting twenty-five per cent. in
consideration of what I believe the lawyers call
‘natural love and affection’; in other words, because
I’d much sooner sell to you than to a stranger&mdash;in
fact, than to <i>anybody else</i>.” The underlining of the
last two words clearly asked me to substitute for
them a proper name with which we were both well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
acquainted. He added that he thought the land
agents’ valuation would be somewhere in the neighborhood
of thirty thousand pounds, timber included&mdash;and
so, with kindest remembrances from Nina,
who was splendidly fit, <i>considering</i> (another underlining
gave me news of possible importance for the
future of the Dundrannan barony), he remained my
affectionate cousin.</p>

<p>Though I suspect that son and father, at the bottom
of their hearts, felt much the same about the
matter, Sir Paget’s letter was expressed in a different
vein. Leaving the business to Waldo, he dealt with
the personal aspect:</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you that I
hadn’t always hoped and expected that the heir of
my body and the child of my dear wife should succeed
me here. That’s nature; but <i>Dis aliter visum</i>.
The All-Highest herself decides otherwise.” (I
saw in my mind the humorous, rather tired, smile
with which he wrote that.) “But I should be an
ungrateful churl indeed if I repined at the prospect
of being succeeded at Cragsfoot by you, who bear
the old name (and, I am told, are to get a handle to
it!)&mdash;you who are and have been always son of my
heart, if not of my body&mdash;a loyal, true son too, if
you will let me say it. So, if it is to be, I receive it
with happiness, and the more you come to your
future dominions while I&mdash;<i>brevis dominus</i>&mdash;am still
here to welcome you, the better I shall be pleased.
But, prithee, Julius, remember that you provide, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
your own person, only for the next generation.
When your turn comes for the doleful cypresses,
what is to happen? You must look to it, my boy!”</p>

<p>After a touching reference to his old and now lost
companion, Aunt Bertha, and to his own loneliness,
he went on more lightly: “But Waldo comes over
every day from Briarmount when they are ‘in residence,’
and the aforesaid All-Highest herself pays
me a state visit once or twice a week. The Queen-Regent
expects an Heir-Apparent. Oh, confidently!
I think she can’t quite make out how fate, or nature,
or the other Deity dared to thwart her, last time!
I confess I am hypnotized&mdash;I too have no doubt of
the event! So, as to that, all is calm and confidence&mdash;the
third peer of the line is on his way! But is there
anything wrong in her outlying dominions? Villa
San Carlo, though it sounds like a charming winter
palace, doesn’t seem to have been an unqualified
success. ‘Rather tiresome down there!’ she said.
I asked politely after the cousin. Very well, when
she had seen him last, but she really didn’t know
what he was doing; it seemed to her that he was
taking a very long holiday from business&mdash;‘Our
works down there are of only secondary importance.’
I remarked that you had written saying
how much you were enjoying yourself at Villa San
Carlo, and how you regretted being detained in
Paris. ‘Oh, he meant to leave us anyhow, I think!’
I fancied somehow that both of you gentleman had
incurred the royal displeasure. What have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
been up to? Rebellion, <i>lèse-majesté</i>, treason?
You are bold men if you defy my Lady Dundrannan!
Well, she’s probably right in thinking that Cragsfoot
is too small for her, and not worth adding to
her dominions!”</p>

<p>Though the purchase would need some contriving,
the price that Waldo’s letter indicated was not an
insuperable difficulty, thanks to the value which Sir
Ezekiel was now kind enough to put on my services;
I could pay it, and keep up the place on a footing of
frugal decency when the time came. For the rest,
the prospect was attractive. Cragsfoot had always
been an integral part of my life; my orphaned childhood
had been spent there. If it passed to a
stranger, I should feel as it were dug up by the roots.
If I did not fall in with the arrangement, pass to a
stranger it would; I felt sure of that; the All-Highest
had issued her command. “So be it!” I
said to myself&mdash;half in pleasure, still half in resentment
at the Dundrannan fiat, which broke the direct
line of the Rillingtons of Cragsfoot. I also made
up my mind to obey Sir Paget’s implied invitation as
soon as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As soon as what? The summons from Cragsfoot&mdash;the
call back to home and home life (my appointment
to our London office was now ratified)&mdash;brought
me up against that question. I could
answer it only by saying&mdash;as soon as Lucinda’s affair
had somehow settled itself. She could not be
left where she was; as a permanency, the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
situation was intolerable. She must yield or she
must go; Valdez would never let her alone, short of
her adopting one of those alternatives; he would
keep on at his pestering and posturing. She had no
money; her mother had lived on an annuity, or an
allowance, or something of that kind, which expired
with the good lady herself. Clearly, however, she
was able to support herself. She must not sell
flowers on the Piazza all her life; I thought that she
would consent to borrow enough money from me to
set herself up in a modest way in business, and I determined
to make that proposal to her on the morrow&mdash;as
soon as we had got through the ordeal of
this evening’s dinner. I fervently hoped that we
might get through it without a flare-up between Arsenio
and his honored guest Godfrey Frost. Out
of favor at Briarmount was he, that young man?
I could easily have told Sir Paget the reason for
that!</p>

<p>The only one of the prospective party whom I encountered
in the course of the afternoon&mdash;though I
admit that I haunted the Piazza in the hope of seeing
Lucinda&mdash;was the host himself. I met him in
company with a tall, lean visaged, eminently respectable
person, wearing a tall hat and a black
frock coat. Arsenio stopped me, and introduced
me to his companion. He said that Signor Alessandro
Panizzi and I ought to know one another; I
didn’t see why, and merely supposed that he was
exhibiting his respectable friend, who was, it appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
one of the leading lawyers in Venice and,
indeed, an ex-Syndic of the city. Signor Panizzi, on
his part, treated Arsenio with the greatest deference;
he referred to him, in the course of our brief
conversation, as “our noble friend,” and was apparently
hugely gratified by the familiar, if somewhat
lordly, bearing which Arsenio adopted towards
him. But, after all, Arsenio was now rich&mdash;notoriously
so, thanks to the way in which wealth had
come to him; one could understand that he might be
regarded as a highly-to-be-valued citizen of Venice.
Perhaps he was going to run for Mayor himself&mdash;one
more brilliant device to dazzle Lucinda!</p>

<p>There it was&mdash;in thinking of him one always expected,
one always came back to, the bizarre, the incongruous
and ridiculous. It was the overpowering
instinct for the dramatic, the theatrical, in him, without
any taste to guide or to limit it. That was
what made it impossible to take him, or his emotions
and attitudes, seriously; Waldo’s “all that” seemed
just the applicable description. I walked away
wondering just what particular line his bamboozlement
of Signor Alessandro Panizzi might be taking.
Moreover, that he could find leisure in his thoughts
to posture to somebody else&mdash;besides Lucinda and
myself&mdash;was reassuring. It made his hints of the
night before seem even more unreal and fantastic.</p>

<p>That same last word was the only one appropriate
to describe what I found happening to my unfortunate
<i>salon</i>, when I got back early in the evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Half a dozen men, under the superintendence
of Louis and the fat old <i>portière</i> who lived
in a sort of cupboard on the ground floor, opening
off the hall, were engaged in transforming it into
what they obviously considered to be a scene of
splendor. The old <i>portière</i> was rubbing his plump
hands in delight; at last Don Arsenio was launching
out, spending his money handsomely, doing justice to
Palazzo Valdez; the rich English nobleman (this
was Godfrey Frost&mdash;probably after Arsenio’s own
description) would undoubtedly be much impressed.
Very possibly&mdash;but possibly not quite as old Amedeo
expected! The table groaned&mdash;or at all events
I groaned for it&mdash;under silver plate and silver
candlesticks. The latter were also stuck galore in
sconces on the walls. Table and walls were
festooned with chains of white flowers; the like
bedecked the one handsome thing that really belonged
to the room&mdash;the antique chandelier in the
middle of the ceiling; I had never put lights in it,
but they were there now. And the banquet was to
be on a scale commensurate with these trappings.
“Prodigious! Considering the times, absolutely
prodigious!” Amedeo assured me; he, for his part,
could not conceive how Don Arsenio and Signor
Louis had contrived to obtain the materials for such
a feast. Signor Louis smiled mysteriously; tricks
of the trade were insinuated.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Arsenio had gone stark
mad. What were we in for this evening?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as this thought once again seized on my
mind, I saw something that gave me a little start.
The butt of a revolver or pistol protruded from the
side-pocket of Louis’s jacket, and the pocket bulged
with the rest of the weapon.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you carrying that thing
about for?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Valdez told me to clean it,” he
answered quietly. “He gave it to me for that purpose&mdash;out
of his bureau.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t tell you to carry it about with you
while you did your work, did he?”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t,” said Arsenio’s voice just behind
me. The door stood open for the workers, and he
had come in, in his usual quiet fashion. I turned
round, to find him grinning at me. “Give it here,
Louis,” he ordered, and slipped the thing into his
own pocket. “The room looks fine now, doesn’t
it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What do you want with your revolver to-day?”
I asked.</p>

<p>He looked at me with malicious glee. “Aha,
Julius, I did frighten you last night then, after all!
You pretended to be very scornful, but I did make
an impression! Or else why do you question me
about my revolver?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t believe a word of that nonsense you
hinted at last night,” I protested. “But what do you
want with your revolver?”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I don’t want to boast of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
wealth, but there’s a considerable sum of money
in my bureau&mdash;very considerable. No harm in
being on the safe side, is there?”</p>

<p>That seemed reasonable: his manner too changed
suddenly from derision to a plausible common sense.
“Possessing a revolver&mdash;as most of us who served
do&mdash;doesn’t mean that one intends to use it&mdash;on
oneself or on anybody else, does it?”</p>

<p>I felt at a loss. When he wanted me to believe,
I didn’t. When he wanted me not to believe, I did&mdash;or,
at all events, half did. With Arsenio the
plausible sensible explanation was always suspect; to
be merely sensible was so contrary to his nature.</p>

<p>The busy men had apparently finished their ridiculous
work. Louis came in and looked round with
a satisfied air.</p>

<p>“Splendid, Louis!” said Arsenio. “Here, take
this thing and put it on the bureau in my room.”
As Louis obediently took the revolver and left us
alone together, Arsenio added to me: “Don’t
spoil your dinner&mdash;a good one, I hope, for these
hungry days&mdash;by taking seriously anything I said
last night. Perhaps in the end I did mean&mdash;No, I
didn’t really. I was wrought up. My friend,
wasn’t it natural?”</p>

<p>Well, it was natural, of course. On a man prone
to what Lucinda had called “heroics” the hour in
which she had given him that kiss&mdash;the kiss of farewell,
as we had both interpreted it to be&mdash;would
naturally induce them. I should have been disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
to accept his disclaimer of any desperate intentions,
except for the fact that somehow he still seemed to
be watching me, watching what effect his words had
on me, and rather curiously anxious to efface the impression
which the sudden appearance of the revolver
had made upon me.</p>

<p>“Last night&mdash;yes!” He dropped into a chair.
“Her action affected me strangely. It is long since
she kissed me. And then to kiss me like that! Can
you wonder that I gave way?” He smiled up at
me. “One doesn’t easily part from Lucinda. Why,
you told me that Waldo&mdash;our old Waldo&mdash;went
nearly mad with rage when I took her from him.”
His brows went up and he smiled. “It needed a
European War to save me, you said! Well, if my
excitements are not as tremendous as Waldo’s, I
must admit that they are more frequent. But to-day
I’ve come to my senses. Pray believe me, my
dear Julius&mdash;and don’t let any absurd notion spoil
your dinner.”</p>

<p>He was very anxious to convince me. My mind
obstinately urged the question: Was he afraid that
I might watch him, that I might interfere with his
plan? I tried to shake off the notion&mdash;not quite
successfully. I had a feeling that “heroics” might
be like strong drink; a man could indulge in a lot
of them, and yet be master of them&mdash;and of himself.
But there might come a point where they would gain
the mastery, and he would be a slave. In which
case&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“You think this dinner of mine a mad affair?” I
found Arsenio saying. “Well, think so, in your
stolid English fashion!” He shrugged his shoulders
scornfully. “You don’t see what it means?
Oh, of course you don’t! I suppose you love Lucinda
as well&mdash;I said, Julius, that you loved Lucinda
as well&mdash;and the one merit of the English language
is, that ‘love’ is a tolerably distinctive word when applied
to a woman&mdash;in that damned black frock as if
she were dressed as her beauty deserves? Well, I
don’t; I know&mdash;we know, we Southerners&mdash;how the
setting enhances the jewel. By my cunning incitements&mdash;you
heard, but you had no ears&mdash;she will
dress herself to-night; you’ll see!” He waved his
hands to embrace the room. “And I have given
her suitable surroundings!”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s about time that we bedecked ourselves,”
I suggested, rather wearily.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but one moment!” He leant forward in
his chair. “What’s to become of her, Julius?”</p>

<p>I answered him rather fiercely, brutally perhaps.
“I think you’ve lost the right to concern yourself
with that.”</p>

<p>“I have, I know. Hence the occasion of this evening.
But you, Julius?”</p>

<p>“I shall always be at her service, if she needs
help. As you know, she’s very independent.”</p>

<p>He nodded his head. Then he smiled his monkey
smile. “And there’s Godfrey Frost, of course.
Entirely in a position to assist her! A sound head!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
A good business man! Wants his price, but&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“Oh, damn you, go and dress for your infernal
dinner!”</p>

<p>The devil was in him. He got up with a grin.
“I doubt whether you’ll be very good company!
Oh, let’s see, where’s that revolver? Oh, I gave
it back to Louis, so I did! Our esteemed friend
ought to be here in half an hour. Do you happen
to know that he and Lucinda have been to the Lido
together this afternoon? No, you don’t? Oh,
yes! My friend Alessandro and I saw them embarking.
Doesn’t that fact add a further interest
to this evening? But look at the room&mdash;the table!
Shall we not outshine the Frost millions to-night&mdash;you
and I, Julius?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my affair, thank God!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s as it may turn out! <i>Au revoir</i>, then,
in half an hour!”</p>

<p>He succeeded in leaving me in about as bewildered
a state of mind as I have ever been in in all my life;
I, who have often had to decide whether a politician
was an honest man or not!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BANQUET</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">SINCE I was not to play host that evening, I
decided to let Arsenio be first on the gaudy
scene which he had prepared. He should
receive the other guests; he should take undivided
responsibility for the decorations. I waited until I
heard him come down and speak to Louis, and even
until I heard&mdash;as I very well could, in my little bedroom
adjoining the <i>salon</i>&mdash;Louis announcing first
“Monsieur Froost,” and then&mdash;no, it was fat old
Amedeo who effected the second announcement, arrogating
to himself the rights of an old family servant&mdash;that
of the most excellent and noble Signora
Donna Lucinda Valdez. Thereupon I entered,
Amedeo favoring me with no laudatory epithets,
but leaving me to content myself with Louis’ brief
“Monsieur Reelinton.”</p>

<p>Lucinda was in splendor; she was&mdash;as I, at least,
had never before seen her&mdash;a grown woman in a
grown woman’s evening finery. Through all her
wanderings she must have dragged this gown about,
a relic of her pre-war status&mdash;for all I knew, part of
the <i>trousseau</i> of the prospective Mrs. Waldo Rillington!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
But it did not look seriously out of
fashion. (If I remember right, women dressed on
substantially the same lines just before the war as
they did in the first months after it.) It was a
white gown, simple but artistic, of sumptuous material.
She wore no ornaments&mdash;it was not difficult
to conjecture the reason for that&mdash;only her favorite
scarlet flower in her fair hair; yet the effect of her
was one of magnificence&mdash;of a restrained, tantalizing
richness, both of body and of raiment.</p>

<p>Whether she had arrayed herself thus in kindness
or in cruelty, or in some odd mixture of the two, indulging
Arsenio’s freak with one hand, while the
other buffeted him with a vision of what he had lost,
I know not; but a glance at her face showed that her
tenderer mood was now past. Arsenio’s decorations
had done for it! She was looking about her
with brows delicately raised, with amusement
triumphant on her lips and in her eyes. If Arsenio’s
frippery had been meant to appeal to anything except
her humor, it had failed disastrously. It had
driven her back to her scorn, back to her conception
of him as a trickster, a mountebank, a creature
whose promises meant nothing, whose threats meant
less; an amusing ape&mdash;and there an end of him!</p>

<p>But perhaps the plate and the festoons might impress
the third guest, who completed Arsenio’s
party. Godfrey Frost did not, at first sight, seem
so much as to notice them, to know that they were
there. His eyes were all for Lucinda. Small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
wonder, indeed! but they did not seek or follow her
in frank and honest admiration, nor yet in the chivalrous
though sorrowful longing of unsuccessful love.
There was avidity in them, but also anger and
grudge; rancor struggling with desire. He was not
looking amiable, the third guest. He set me wondering
what had passed on the Lido that afternoon.</p>

<p>Arsenio sat down with the air of a man who had
done a good day’s work and felt justified in enjoying
his dinner and his company. He set Lucinda
to his right at the little square table, Godfrey to his
left, myself opposite. He gave a glance round the
three of us.</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re amused,” he said to Lucinda, with
his quick reading of faces. “Well, you know my
ways by now!” His voice sounded good-humored,
free from chagrin or disappointment. “And, after
all, it’s my first and last celebration of the bit of
luck that Number Twenty-one at last brought me.”</p>

<p>“The first and last bit of luck too, I expect,” she
said; but she too was gay and easy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall back it no more; its work is done.
Not bad champagne, is it, considering? Louis got
it somehow. I told you he’d bring luck, Julius!
Louis, fill Mr. Frost’s glass!” He sipped at his
own, and then went on. “The charm of a long
shot, of facing long odds&mdash;that’s what I’ve always
liked. That’s the thing for us gamblers! And
who isn’t a gambler&mdash;willingly or <i>malgré lui</i>? He
who lives gambles; so does he who dies&mdash;except,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
of course, for the saving rites of the Church.”</p>

<p>“You were a little late with that reservation, Arsenio,”
I remarked.</p>

<p>“You heretics are hardly worthy of it at all,” he
retorted, smiling. “But, to gamble well, you must
gamble whole-heartedly. No balancing of chances,
no cutting the loss, no trying to have it both ways.
Don’t you agree with me, Frost?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that Mr. Frost agrees with you
in the least,” Lucinda put in. “He thinks it’s quite
possible to have it both ways. Don’t you, Mr.
Frost? To win without losing is your idea!”</p>

<p>He gave her a long look, a reluctant sour smile.
She was bantering him&mdash;over something known to
them, only to be conjectured by Arsenio and me;
something that had passed on the Lido? She had
for him a touch of the detached scornful amusement
which Arsenio’s decorations had roused in her, but
with a sharper tang in it&mdash;more bite to less laughter.</p>

<p>“I’m not a gambler, though I’m not afraid of a
business risk,” he answered.</p>

<p>She laughed lightly. “A business risk would
never have brought the splendor of to-night!” She
smiled round at the ridiculously festooned walls.</p>

<p>We were quickly disposing of an excellent, well-served
dinner; Louis was quick and quiet, fat Amedeo
more sensible than he looked, undoubtedly a
good cook was in the background. Growing physically
very comfortable, I got largely rid of the queer
apprehensions which had haunted me; I paid less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
heed to Arsenio, and more to the secret subtle duel
which seemed to be going on between the other two.
Arsenio played more with his topic&mdash;birth, death,
life, love&mdash;all gambles into which men and women
were involuntarily thrown, with no choice but to
play the cards or handle the dice; all true and obvious
in a superficial sort of way, but it seemed
rather trifling&mdash;a mood in which life can be regarded,
but one in which few men or women really
live it. That he was one of the few himself, however,
I was quite prepared to concede; the magnitude
of his gains&mdash;and of his loss&mdash;as convincing.</p>

<p>Louis and Amedeo served us with coffee and Louis
set a decanter of brandy in front of Arsenio.</p>

<p>Then they left us alone. Arsenio poured himself
out a glass of brandy, and handed the decanter
round. Holding his glass in his hand, he turned to
Lucinda. “Will you drink with me&mdash;to show that
you forgive my sins?”</p>

<p>Her eyes widened a little at the suddenness of the
appeal; but she smiled still, and answered lightly,
“Oh, I’ll drink with you&mdash;&mdash;” She sipped her
brandy&mdash;“in memory of old days, Arsenio!”</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, nodding his head at her gravely.
She had refused to drink with him on his terms;
she would do it only on her own. “Still&mdash;you shall
forgive,” he persisted with one of his cunning smiles.
Then he turned suddenly to Godfrey Frost with a
change of manner&mdash;with a cold malice that I had
never seen in him before, a malice with no humor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
in it, a straightforward viciousness. “Then let us
drink together, my friend!” he said. “It was with
that object that I brought you here to-night. We’ll
drink together, as we have failed together, Godfrey
Frost! A business risk you spoke of just now! It
wasn’t a bad speculation! A couple of hundred or
so&mdash;Oh, I had more from your cousin, but her
motives were purely charitable, eh?&mdash;just a beggarly
couple of hundred for a chance at that!” A gesture
indicated Lucinda. His voice rose; it took on
its rhetorical note, and the words fell into harmony
with it. “To buy a man’s honor and beauty like
that for a couple of hundred&mdash;not a bad risk!”</p>

<p>Godfrey looked as if he had been suddenly hit in
the face; he turned a deep red and leant forward
towards his host&mdash;his very queer host. He was too
shaken up to be ready with a reply. Lucinda sat
motionless, apparently aloof from the scene. But
a very faint smile was still on her lips.</p>

<p>“What the devil’s the use of this sort of thing?”
I expostulated&mdash;in a purely conventional spirit, with
one’s traditional reprobation of “scenes.” My feeling
somehow went no deeper. It seemed then an
inevitable thing that these three should have it out,
before they went their several ways; the conventions
were all broken between them.</p>

<p>“Because the truth’s good for him&mdash;and for me;
for both of us who trafficked in her.”</p>

<p>Lucinda suddenly interposed, in a delicate scorn,
an unsparing truthfulness. “It’s only because you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
failed yourself that you’re angry with him, Arsenio.
Let him alone; he’s had enough truth from me this
afternoon&mdash;and a lot of good advice. I told him
to go home&mdash;to Nina Dundrannan. And for
Heaven’s sake don’t talk about ‘trafficking,’ as if you
were some kind of a social reformer!”</p>

<p>She turned to me, actually laughing; and I began
to laugh too. Well, Godfrey looked absurd&mdash;like
a dog being whipped by two people at once, not
knowing which he most wanted to bite, not sure
whether he dared bite either&mdash;possibly thinking
also of a third whipping which would certainly befall
him if he followed Lucinda’s good advice. And
Arsenio, cruelly let down from his heroics, looked
funnily crestfallen too. He was not allowed to be
picturesquely, rhetorically indignant&mdash;not with Godfrey,
not even with himself!</p>

<p>“Besides,” she added, “he did offer to stick to
his engagement to lunch with me that day at Cimiez!”</p>

<p>The mock admiration and gratitude with which
she recalled this valiant deed&mdash;to which she might,
in my opinion, well have dedicated a friendlier tone,
since it was no slight exploit for him to beard his
Nina in that fashion&mdash;put a limit to poor Godfrey’s
tongue-tied endurance.</p>

<p>“Yes, you were ready enough to take my lunches,
and what else you could get!” he sneered.</p>

<p>Lucinda gave me just a glance; here was a business
reckoner indeed! Of course he had some right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
on his side, but he saw his right so carnally; why
couldn’t he have told her that they’d been friends&mdash;and
who could be only a friend to her? That
was what, I expect, he meant in his heart; but his
instincts were blunt, and he had been lashed into
soreness.</p>

<p>Still, though I was feeling for him to that extent,
I could not help returning Lucinda’s glance with a
smile, while Arsenio chuckled in an exasperating
fashion. It was small wonder really that he pushed
back his chair from the table and, looking round
at the company, groaned out, “Oh, damn the lot
of you!”</p>

<p>The simplicity of this retort went home. I felt
guilty myself, and Lucinda was touched to remorse,
if not to shame. “I told you not to come to-night,”
she murmured. “I told you that he only wanted
to tease you. You’d better go away, perhaps.” She
looked at him, and his glance obeyed hers instantly;
she put out her hand and laid it on one of his for
just a moment. “And, after all, I did like the
lunches. You’re quite right there! Arsenio, can’t
we part friends to-night&mdash;since we must part, all
of us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as you like!” said Arsenio impatiently. A
sudden and deep depression seemed to fall upon
him; he sat back, staring dejectedly at the table.
He reminded one of a comedian whose jokes do not
carry. This banquet was to have been a great, grim
joke. But it had fallen flat&mdash;sunk now into just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
a wrangle. And at last his buoyant malice failed
to lift it&mdash;failed him indeed completely. We three
men sat in a dull silence; I saw Lucinda’s eyes grow
dim with tears.</p>

<p>Godfrey broke the silence by rising to his feet,
clumsily, almost with a stumble; I think that he
caught his foot in the tablecloth, which hung down
almost to the floor.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” he said. “I’m sorry for all this. I’ve
made a damned fool of myself.”</p>

<p>Nobody else spoke, or rose.</p>

<p>“If it’s any excuse”&mdash;he almost stumbled in his
speech, as he had almost stumbled with his feet&mdash;“I
love Lucinda. And you’ve used her damnably,
Valdez.”</p>

<p>“For what I’ve done, I pay. For you&mdash;go and
learn what love is.” This, though as recorded it
sounds like his theatrical manner, was not so delivered.
It came from him in a low, dreary voice,
as though he were totally dispirited. He glanced
at the clock on the mantelpiece; it had gone ten
o’clock; he seemed to shiver as he noted the hour.
He looked across at me with a helpless appeal in
his eyes. He looked like an animal in a trap; a
trap bites no less deeply for being of one’s own
devising.</p>

<p>Godfrey was staring at him now in a dull, uncomprehending
bewilderment. Lucinda put her elbows
on the table, and supported her chin in her
hands, her eyes set inquiringly on his face. I myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
stretched out my hand and clasped one of his. But
he shook off my grasp, raised his hands in the air
and let them fall with a thud on the table; all the
things on it rattled; even the heavy plate that he
had bought or hired&mdash;I didn’t know which&mdash;for his
futile banquet. Then he blurted out, in the queerest
mixture of justification, excuse, defiance, bravado:
“Oh, you don’t understand, but to me it means damnation!
And I can’t do it; now&mdash;now the time’s
come, I can’t!” There was no doubt about his actual,
physical shuddering now.</p>

<p>Lucinda did not move; she just raised her eyes
from where he sat to where Godfrey stood. “You’d
better go,” she said. “Julius and I must manage
this.” Her tone was contemptuous still.</p>

<p>I got up and took Godfrey’s arm. He let me
lead him out of the room without resistance, and,
while I was helping him on with his hat and coat,
asked in a bewildered way, “What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“He meant to go out in a blaze of glory&mdash;with
a <i>beau geste</i>! But he hasn’t got the pluck for it at
the finish. That’s about the size of it.”</p>

<p>“My God, what a chap! What a queer chap!”
he mumbled, as he began to go downstairs. He
turned his head back. “See you to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Lord, I don’t know! I’ve got him to look after.
He might find his courage again! I can’t leave
him alone. Good-night.” I watched him down to
the next landing, and then went back towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
<i>salon</i>. I did not think of shutting the outer door
behind me.</p>

<p>Just on the threshold of the <i>salon</i> I met Arsenio
himself in the act of walking out of the room, rather
unsteadily. “Where are you going?” I demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>“Only to get some whisky. I’ve a bottle in my
room. I want a whisky-and-soda. It’s all right;
it really is now, old fellow.”</p>

<p>“I shall come with you.” I knew of a certain
thing that he had in his own room upstairs, and
was not going to trust him alone.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders slightly, but made no
further objection. “We’ll be back in a minute,” I
called out to Lucinda, who was still sitting at the
table, her attitude unchanged. Then Arsenio and
I passed through the open door and went up the
stairs together. As we started on our way, he said,
with a curious splutter that was half a sob in his
voice, “Lucinda knows me best, and you see she’s
not afraid. She didn’t try to stop me.”</p>

<p>“She’s never believed you meant it at all; but
I did,” I answered.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE MASCOT</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">ARSENIO opened the door of the apartment
with his latchkey and stood aside to let me
pass in first. The door of his sitting room,
the long, narrow room which I have described before,
stood slightly ajar, and a light shone through
it. I advanced across the passage&mdash;the hall could
hardly be called more&mdash;and flung the door wide
open as I entered, Arsenio following just behind.</p>

<p>There, in the middle of the room, two or three
paces from the big bureau, one side of which flapped
open, showing shelves and drawers, stood Louis the
valet, the waiter from that “establishment” of Arsenio’s
at Nice, the seller of the winning ticket, the
author of Arsenio’s luck. In his left hand he held,
clasped against his body, a large black leather portfolio
or letter case; in his right was the revolver
which his master had given him to clean.</p>

<p>He stood quite still, frightened, as it seemed, into
immobility, glaring at us with a terrified face. He
had thought that we were safely bestowed, round
the table downstairs, for some time to come. Our
footsteps on the stairs had disturbed him when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
work was almost finished; our entrance cut off his
retreat. Even if he had had the presence of mind
to bar the door, it would have given him only a brief
respite; escape by the window was impossible; but
he did not look as if he were capable of reckoning
up the situation, or his chances, at all. He was
numb with fear.</p>

<p>“Drop that thing, you scoundrel!” I cried; and
it is my belief to this day that he would have
obeyed me, put down his weapon, and meekly surrendered,
if he had been let alone. He was certainly
not built for a burglar or for deeds of violence,
though I suppose the possession of the revolver
had nerved him to this enterprise of his.</p>

<p>But Arsenio did not let him alone, or wait to
see the effect of my order. Even as I spoke, he
dashed forward in front of me, uttering a wild cry;
it did not sound like fear&mdash;either for his money or
for his life&mdash;or even like rage; really, it sounded
more like triumph than anything else. And he made
straight for the armed man, utterly regardless of
the weapon that he held.</p>

<p>Thus put to it, Louis fired&mdash;once, twice. Arsenio
ran, as it were, right on to the first bullet. I
had darted forward to support his attempt to rush
the thief&mdash;if that really was what he had in his
mind&mdash;and he fell back plump into my arms, just as
the second bullet whizzed past my head. Then
with a yell of sheer horror&mdash;at what he had done,
I suppose&mdash;Louis dropped the revolver with a bang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
on the floor, dropped the fat portfolio too with a
flop, and, before I, cumbered with Arsenio’s helpless
body, could do anything to stop him, bolted out
of the room like a scared rabbit. I heard his feet
pattering down the stairs at an incredible pace.</p>

<p>Arsenio was groaning and clutching at his chest.
I supported him to his shabby old sofa, and laid
him down there. Then I violently rang the bell
which communicated with the ground floor where
Amedeo abode.</p>

<p>The next moment Lucinda came into the room&mdash;very
quickly, but calmly. “Did he do it himself,
after all?”</p>

<p>“No, Louis; he’d been rifling the bureau; and the
revolver&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, it was Louis that I heard running downstairs!
I’ll look after him. Go for a doctor.”
There were no telephones in the old <i>palazzo</i>; the
owner had not spent his precarious gains in that
fashion!</p>

<p>“I thought of sending Amedeo&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll be quicker. Go, Julius.” She knelt down
by Arsenio’s sofa.</p>

<p>As I went on my errand&mdash;I knew of a doctor who
lived quite close&mdash;I met old Amedeo, lumbering upstairs,
half-dressed, and told him what had happened.
“He looks very bad,” I added.</p>

<p>Amedeo flung up his hands with pious ejaculations.
“As I go by the <i>piano nobile</i> I’ll call Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Garcia, and take him up with me. Don Arsenio’s
a good Catholic.”</p>

<p>Yes! That fact perhaps had something to do
with the course which events had ultimately taken
that night!</p>

<p>When I got back with the doctor&mdash;he had gone
to bed, and kept me waiting&mdash;Arsenio had been
moved into his bedroom. The priest was still with
him, but, when he was informed of the doctor’s
arrival, he came out and Amedeo took the doctor
in to the patient, on whom Lucinda was attending.</p>

<p>Father Garcia was a tall, imposing old ecclesiastic,
of Spanish extraction, and apparently a friend
of the Valdez family, for he spoke of “Arsenio”
without prefix. “I have done my office. The doctor
can do nothing&mdash;Oh, I’ve seen many men die
in the war, and I can tell! He’s just conscious, but
he can hardly speak&mdash;it hurts him to try. Poor
Arsenio! His father was a very worthy man, and
this poor boy was a good son of the Church. For
the rest&mdash;&mdash;!” He shrugged his ample shoulders;
he was probably reflecting the opinions of the aristocratic
and antiquated coterie which Arsenio had
been in the habit of laying under requisitions when
he was in Venice. “But a curious event, a curious
event, just after his prodigious luck!” Father
Garcia’s eyes bulged rather, and they seemed to
grow bulgier still as, between sniffs at a pinch of
snuff, he exclaimed slowly, “Three million francs!
Donna Lucinda will be rich!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The old fellow seemed disposed to gossip; there
was nothing else to do, while we awaited the verdict.</p>

<p>“A gamester, I’m afraid, yes. His father feared
as much for him&mdash;and a good many of my friends
had reason to suspect the same. You’re a friend
of his, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Rillington, sir,” I said.</p>

<p>He raised his brows above his bulging eyes. “Oh!&mdash;er&mdash;let
me see! Wasn’t Donna Lucinda herself
a Rillington&mdash;or am I making a mistake?”</p>

<p>“Only just,” said I. I couldn’t help smiling.
“Donna Lucinda all but became a Rillington&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he interrupted. “Now I remember the
story. Some visitors from London brought it over
in the early days of the war&mdash;I think they were
propaganda agents of your nation, in fact. It was
before Italy made the mis&mdash;&mdash;it was before Italy
joined in the war.”</p>

<p>“Donna Lucinda’s maiden name was Knyvett.
Her mother and she once rented this very apartment
from Arsenio, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I think I remember that too.” However,
he did not seem to remember too much about
it, for he went on. “And so the romance started,
I suppose! She’s a very beautiful woman, Mr. Rillington.”</p>

<p>The expression in his eyes justified my next remark.
“Whatever else one may say about the
poor fellow, he was a devoted lover to his wife, and
she was&mdash;absolutely true to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m old-fashioned enough to think that that
covers a multitude of sins. She’s not, I gather, a
Catholic?”</p>

<p>“No, I believe not.”</p>

<p>“A pity!” he said meditatively; whether he was
thinking of Lucinda’s soul or of her money, I didn’t
know&mdash;and I will forbear from speculating. If he
was thinking about the money, it was, of course, only
with an eye&mdash;a bulging eye&mdash;on other people’s souls&mdash;as
well as Lucinda’s.</p>

<p>“Pray, sir,” I asked, on a sudden impulse, “do
you know anything of a friend of Arsenio’s here&mdash;Signor
Alessandro Panizzi?”</p>

<p>“I know what everybody knows,” he replied with
a sudden fierceness&mdash;“that he’s a pestilent fellow&mdash;a
radical, a freemason, an atheist! Was he a friend
of Arsenio’s?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I really don’t know. I happened to
meet them walking together on the Piazza this
afternoon, and Arsenio introduced me.”</p>

<p>“Then he kept worse company than any of us
suspected,” the old priest sternly pronounced. If
the opinion thus indicated was a just one, Signor
Panizzi must be a very bad man indeed! I was
just adding hastily that I knew nothing of the man
myself (he had looked the acme of respectability)
when Lucinda opened the door of the room and
beckoned to me. With a low bow to Father Garcia,
who was still looking outraged at the thought of
Signor Panizzi, I obeyed her summons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“He has only a few minutes to live,” she whispered
hurriedly, as we crossed the passage. “He
seems peaceful in mind, and suffers little pain, except
when he tries to speak. Still I’m sure there’s
something he wants to say to you; I saw it in his
eyes when I mentioned your name.”</p>

<p>He was in bed, partly undressed. The end was
obviously very near. The doctor was standing a
yard or two from the bed, not attempting any further
ministration. I bent over Arsenio, low down,
nearly to his pale face, and laid my hand gently on
one of his. He did look peaceful; and, as he saw
me, the ghost of his monkeyish smile formed itself
on his lips. He spoke, with a groan and an effort:
“I told you&mdash;Julius&mdash;that fellow would&mdash;bring me
luck. But you never believed&mdash;you never believed&mdash;in
my&mdash;&mdash;” His voice choked, his words ended,
and his eyes closed. It was only a few minutes
more before we left him to the offices of old Amedeo
and the old wife whom he summoned from
their cupboard of a place on the ground floor.</p>

<p>By this time the police were on the scene; there
is no need to detail their formalities, though they
took some time. The case appeared a simple one,
but Lucinda and I were told that we must stay
where we were, pending investigations, and the arrest
and trial of Louis; we knew him by no other
name, and knew about him no more than what
Arsenio had told me. They let Lucinda retire to
her apartment soon after midnight, and me to mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
half an hour later; one of them remained on duty
in the hall of the <i>palazzo</i>; and, of course, they took
that portfolio away with them.</p>

<p>In the end the formalities proved to be just that,
and no more. Two days later a body was found
in the Grand Canal, having been in the water apparently
about thirty hours. Amedeo and I identified
it. The inference was that, although Louis had
no stomach for fighting, he had that form of courage
in which his master had at the last moment
failed; it is probable that he was not a good Catholic.
I felt indebted to him for the manner of his
end; it saved us a vast deal of trouble. Poor
wretch! I do not believe that he had any more
intention of killing Arsenio than I had myself. The
knowledge of all that money overcame his cupidity;
perhaps he felt some proprietary right in it! The
possession of the revolver probably screwed him up
to the enterprise. But the actual shooting was, I
dare swear, an instinctive act of self-defense; Arsenio’s
furious, seemingly exultant, rush terrified
him. Anyhow, there was an end of him; the mascot
had brought the luck and, having fulfilled its
function, went its appointed way.</p>

<p>But by no means yet an end of Don Arsenio Valdez!
That remarkable person had prepared
posthumous effects, so characteristic of him in their
essence, yet so over-characteristic, that he seemed
to be skillfully burlesquing or travestying himself:
in those last days he must have been in a state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
excitement almost amounting to light-headedness
(he had seemed barely sane at the banquet), a complete
prey to his own vanity and posturing, showing
off on the brink of the grave, contriving how to
show off even after it had closed over him; and
speculating&mdash;I do not in the least doubt&mdash;how all
the business would impress Lucinda. One thing
fails to be said about it: he succeeded in stamping
it with that vinegary comedy which was the truest
hall mark of Monkey Valdez.</p>

<p>Quite early on the morning after the catastrophe&mdash;if
that be the right word to use&mdash;I was sitting
in my room, musing over it and awaiting a summons
from Lucinda, when I was favored with a call from
that eminently respectable (?), most pestilent (?)
person, Signor Alessandro Panizzi. After elaborate
lamentations and eulogies (it would have warmed
Arsenio’s heart to hear them), and explanations
of how he, in his important position, was in close
touch with the police authorities, and so heard of
everything directly it happened, and consequently
had heard of this atrocious crime as soon as he
was out of his bed&mdash;he approached the object of
his visit. I was, he had understood from the deceased
gentleman, his confidential friend; also an
intimate family friend of Donna Lucinda; was I
aware that Don Arsenio had made a disposition of
his property on the afternoon of the very day of
his death?&mdash;“a thing which might impress foolish
and superstitious people,” Signor Panizzi remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
with a sad but superior smile. He himself, as a
notary, had drawn up the document, which Don Arsenio
had executed in due form; it was in his custody;
he produced from his pocket a copy, or rather
an abstract, of the operative part of it. To sum
up this instrument as briefly as possible, Arsenio
bequeathed: First, ten thousand lire to the Reverend
Father Garcia, in trust to cause masses to be said
for his soul, should Holy Church so permit (it
sounded as if Arsenio had his doubts, whether well-founded
or not, I do not know, and, as things had
turned out, immaterial); secondly, the entire residue
of his estate to his wife, the most excellent
Signora Donna Lucinda Valdez, his sole surviving
near relative; but, thirdly, should the said most excellent
Lady, being already fully provided for (!),
accept only the <i>palazzo</i>&mdash;as it was his earnest wish
that she should accept it, his ancestral residence&mdash;and
renounce the inheritance of his personal estate,
then and in that case, he bequeathed the whole of
that personal estate to Signor Alessandro Panizzi
and two other gentlemen (I forgot their names,
but they were both, I subsequently learnt from
Father Garcia, “pestilent” friends of Panizzi’s, one
may suppose, and naturally pestilent), on a trust
to apply the same, in such ways as the law permitted,
to the use and benefit of the City of Venice and its
inhabitants, which and who were so dear to the
heart of the adopted but devoted son of the said
City, Arsenio Valdez.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is prodigious!” said Signor Alessandro Panizzi.
He handed me the abstract, adding, “You
will perhaps like to show it to the Excellent Lady?”
He paused. “It is, of course, a question what
course she will adopt. The sum is a large one, I
understand.”</p>

<p>The anxiety that showed itself in his voice was
natural and creditable to a Venetian patriot&mdash;and
quite intelligible too in a gentleman who saw himself
with the chance of handling an important public
trust. There would be <i>kudos</i> to be got out of
that! But I did not pay much attention to his
anxiety.</p>

<p>“You’re right. It is prodigious,” I said, smiling
broadly in spite of myself. How Arsenio must have
enjoyed giving those instructions! No wonder he
had looked complacent when I met him with Panizzi
on the Piazza; and no wonder that Panizzi had
been so deferential. A foretaste for Arsenio of the
posthumous praise which he was engineering&mdash;the
talk of him after his death, the speculation about
him! Because, of course, he was quite safe with
Lucinda&mdash;and he knew it. He was obliged, I believe,
though I do not profess to know the law, to
leave her part of his property. But it was handsome,
more gallant and chivalrous, to give it all to
her&mdash;in the sure and certain knowledge that she
would not take the money brought by the winning
ticket! And, next to her in his heart came his
dear City of Venice! If not beloved Lucinda, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
beloved Venice! The two Queens of his heart!
What a fine flourish! What an exit for himself
he had prepared! The plaudits would sound loud
and long after he had left the stage.</p>

<p>“It is, of course, possible,” I found Signor Panizzi
saying, “that our lamented friend had discussed
the matter with his wife and that they
had&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s not at all unlikely. You’d like me
to tell her about this?”</p>

<p>“It would, no doubt, be convenient to have, as
soon as possible, an indication of her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Naturally. I’ll speak to her, and let you know
her views as soon as possible. It is a large sum, as
you say. She may desire to take time for consideration.”
I knew that she would not take five minutes.</p>

<p>“I may tell you&mdash;without breach of confidence, I
think&mdash;that our lamented friend was at first disposed
to confine his benefaction, in the event of
its becoming operative by his wife’s renunciation, to
distinctly ecclesiastical charities. I allowed myself
the liberty&mdash;the honor&mdash;of suggesting to him a
wider scope. ‘Why be sectional?’ I suggested. ‘The
gratitude, the remembrance, of all your fellow citizens&mdash;that
would be a greater thing, Don Arsenio,’
I permitted myself to say. And the idea appealed
to him.”</p>

<p>“Really, then,” I remarked, “Venice is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
less indebted to you&mdash;Venice as a whole, I mean&mdash;than
to poor Arsenio himself!”</p>

<p>“No, no, I couldn’t allow that to be said. But
I’m proud if I, in any way, had a humble&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And if that comes out&mdash;and surely
why shouldn’t it?&mdash;everybody will be very grateful
to you&mdash;except perhaps the distinctly ecclesiastical
charities! By the way, do you know this Father
Garcia? He’s living in this house, on the first floor,
and we called him in to see Arsenio&mdash;last night, you
know,&mdash;before he died.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know Father Garcia personally,” he said
stiffly, “but very well by repute.” He paused; I
waited to see what he would say of Father Garcia.
“An utter reactionary, a black reactionary, and none
too good an Italian.” He lowered his voice and
whispered, “Strongly suspected of Austrian sympathies!”</p>

<p>“I see,” I replied gravely. He had almost got
even with the old priest’s “pestilent.”</p>

<p>He rose and bade me a ceremonious farewell.
As he went out, he said, “This bequest&mdash;and
whether it comes into operation or not, it must receive
publicity&mdash;coming from a member of the old
reactionary nobility&mdash;from a Spanish Catholic&mdash;may
well be considered to mark a stage in the growing
solidarity of Italy.”</p>

<p>That seemed as much as even Arsenio himself
could have expected of it!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="pch">HOMAGE</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">LUCINDA’S mental idiosyncrasy resisted any
attempt at idealization; for all that she had
accused me of making the attempt. Though
she would not persist in cruelty, and would remove
herself from the temptation to it when once she had
realized what it was, yet she could be, and had
been, cruel. In like manner she could be hard and
callous, very inaccessible to sentimentality, to that
obvious appeal to the emotions which takes its
strength from our common humanity, with its common
incidents&mdash;its battle, murder, and sudden death&mdash;and
so on. She did not accept these things at
their face value, or in what one may call their universal
aspect. In her inner mind&mdash;she was not very
articulate, or at all theoretical, about it&mdash;but in her
inner mind she seemed to re-value each of such
incidents by an individual and personal standard
which, in its coolness and intellectual detachment,
certainly approached what most of us good human
creatures&mdash;so ready to cry, as we are so ready to
laugh&mdash;would call a degree of callousness. There
was a considerable clear-sightedness in this disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
of hers, but also fully that amount of error
which (as I suppose) our own personality always introduces
into our judgments of people. We see them
through our own spectacles, which sometimes harden
and sometimes soften the outlines of the objects regarded&mdash;among
which is included the wearer of the
spectacles.</p>

<p>She had loved Arsenio once; she had cleaved unto
him with a fidelity to which&mdash;in these days&mdash;her
own word “primitive” must be allowed to be the
most obviously applicable; remorse had smitten her
over her cruelty to him. All the same, in a measure
she erred about him, judging his love solely by
the standard of his conduct, his romance in the light
of his frivolity and shamelessness, his sensibility by
his failure adequately to understand a subtle and
specialized sensibility in herself. That, at least, was
the attitude to which her years of association with
him&mdash;now intimate, now distant and aloof&mdash;had
brought her. It was not, of course, to be attributed
in anything like its entirety to the girl whom he had
kissed at Cragsfoot, or whom he had loved at Venice,
or carried off from Waldo. Her final judgment
of him was the result of what is called, in quite another
connection, a progressive revelation.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that his tragic death was&mdash;to
put it moderately&mdash;no more tragic to her than it
was to me his friend rather by circumstances than
choice or taste, by interest and amusement more
than by affection. She took him at his word, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
to say, and accepted the note of ironical comedy
which he himself was responsible for importing into
the occurrence. Keen-eyed for that aspect, and in
a bitter way keenly appreciative of it, she was blind
to any other, and indeed reluctant to try to see it&mdash;almost
afraid that, even dead, he might befool
her again, still irremediably suspicious that he was
deceiving her by lies and posturings. As a result,
she was really and truly&mdash;in the depths of her soul&mdash;unmoved
by the catastrophe, and not unamused by
the trappings with which Arsenio had be-draped it&mdash;or,
rather, his previously rehearsed but never actually
presented, version of it.</p>

<p>For the outside observer&mdash;comparatively outside,
anyhow&mdash;and for the amateur of comedy and its
material&mdash;human foibles, prejudices, ambitions&mdash;there
was amusement to be had. As soon as Lucinda’s
decision to renounce the inheritance&mdash;except
the <i>palazzo</i> which, as she observed to me, had
been honestly come by, and honestly preserved by
being let out in lodgings&mdash;Arsenio’s last will and
testament became an animated topic of the day&mdash;and
a rather controversial one. The clericals and
their journals&mdash;Signor Panizzi’s black reactionaries
and pro-Austrians&mdash;paid lip-service to the ten
thousand lire for masses, but could not refrain from
some surprise at the choice of trustees which the
lamented Don Arsenio&mdash;a good Catholic and of
old noble stock&mdash;had made (the trustees were all
pestilent, as I had suspected); while the other side&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
patriots, the enlightened, the radicals, the pestilents,
while most gratefully acknowledging his
munificence, and belauding the eminent gentlemen
to whom he had confided his trust, pointed out with
satisfaction how the spirit of progress and enlightenment
had proved too strong in the end even for
a man of Don Arsenio’s clerical antecedents and
proclivities. As for Signor Panizzi, both sides
agreed that his finger had been in the pie; his position
as first and dominating trustee was for the one
a formidable menace to, and for the other a sufficient
guarantee of, a wise, beneficial, and honest administration
of the fund.</p>

<p>Under the spur of this public interest and discussion,
Don Arsenio’s funeral assumed considerable
dimensions, and was in fact quite an affair&mdash;with a
sprinkling of “Blacks,” a larger sprinkling of “pestilents,”
a big crowd of curious Venetian citizens, a
religious service of much pomp conducted by Father
Garcia, followed at the graveside (the priests and
the “Blacks” having withdrawn with significant ceremony)
by a fiery panegyric from Signor Panizzi.
Altogether, when I next go to Venice, I shall not
be surprised to see a statue of Arsenio there; I hope
that the image will wear a smile on its face&mdash;a smile
of his old variety.</p>

<p>Lucinda did not attend the ceremony; it would
have been too much for her feelings&mdash;for some of
her feelings, at all events. But to my surprise I saw
Godfrey Frost there. I had been thrust, against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
my will, into the position of one of the chief mourners;
he kept himself more in the background, and
did not join me until the affair was finished. Then
we extricated ourselves from the crowd as soon as
we could, and made our way back together, ending
up by sitting down to a cup of coffee on the Piazza.
I had seen and heard nothing of him since his disordered
exit from my apartment, just before the
catastrophe. I had indeed been inclined to conclude
that he had left Venice and, not thinking that his
condolences would be well received, had left none
behind him. But here he was&mdash;and in a gloomy
and disgruntled state of mind, as it seemed. He had
been thinking things over, no doubt&mdash;with the natural
conclusion that he had not got much profit or
pleasure out of the whole business, out of that acquaintance
with the Valdez’s, which he had once
pursued so ardently.</p>

<p>“I didn’t choose to seem to run away,” he told
me, “in case there was any investigation, or a trial,
or anything of that kind. Besides”&mdash;he added this
rather reluctantly&mdash;“I had a curiosity to see the
last of the fellow. But they tell me I shan’t be
wanted, as things have turned out, and I’m off to-morrow&mdash;going
home, Julius.”</p>

<p>There was evidently more that he wanted to say.
I smoked in silence.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see Lucinda&mdash;Madame Valdez,”
he blurted out, after a pause. “But I wish you’d
just say that I’m sorry if I annoyed her. I’ve made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
a fool of myself; I’m pretty good at business; but a
fool outside it&mdash;so far, at least. I don’t understand
what she was up to, but&mdash;well, I’m willing to suppose&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I helped him out. “You’re willing to give a lady
the benefit of the doubt? It’s usual, you know. I’ve
very little doubt that she’ll make friends with you
now, if you like.”</p>

<p>He turned to me with a smile, rather sour, yet
shrewd. “Would you think that good enough yourself?”</p>

<p>At first I thought that he was questioning me as
to the state of my own affections. But the words
which he immediately added&mdash;in a more precise definition
of his question&mdash;showed that he was occupied
with his own more important case. “In my
place&mdash;situated as I am, you know?”</p>

<p>As a result of shock, or of meditation thereupon,
or of contemplation of the lamentable life and death
of Arsenio Valdez, Mr. Godfrey Frost was becoming
himself again! I do not think that the Wesleyan
strain had anything to do with the matter at this
stage. It was the Frost business instinct that had
revived, the business view. Godfrey might have
counted the world well lost for Lucinda’s love&mdash;at
all events, well risked; business-risked, so to put it.
But not for the mere friendship, the hope of which
I had held out to him. “In my place&mdash;situated as
I am.” The phrases carried a good deal to me, a
tremendous lot to him. The world&mdash;such a world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
as his&mdash;was not to be lost, or bartered, for less
than a full recompense. After all, whoever did talk
of losing his world for friendship? Most people
think themselves meritorious if they lose a hundred
pounds on that score. And Godfrey had in all likelihood&mdash;the
precise figures were unknown&mdash;already
dropped a good deal more than that, and had taken
in return little but hard words and buffeting. No
wonder the Frost instinct looked suspiciously at any
further venture! Not of actual money, of course;
that stood only as a symbol; and to be even an adequate
symbol would have required immense multiplication.
If a symbol were to be used in any seriousness,
the old one served best&mdash;the old personification
of all that he, in an hour of urgent impulse,
had been willing to lose or to risk for Lucinda.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear fellow,” I said urbanely, “there
were always circumstances, to which we needn’t refer
in detail, that made any intimate acquaintance
between you and the Valdez’s&mdash;well, difficult. Affectation
to deny it! I’ve even felt it myself; of
course in a minor degree.”</p>

<p>“Why a minor degree?” he asked rather aggressively.
“If I’m Nina’s cousin, you’re Waldo’s!”</p>

<p>“There’s all the difference,” I said decisively,
though I was not at all prepared to put the difference
into words. However, I made a weak and
conventional effort: “Old Waldo’s so happy now
that he can’t bear any malice&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He cut across the lame inadequacy of this explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
(not that there wasn’t a bit of truth in it).</p>

<p>“I’m damned rich,” he observed moodily, “and
everybody behaves to me as if I was damned important&mdash;except
you and the Valdez’s, of course.
But I’m not free. Let’s have a liqueur to wash
down that coffee, shall we?”</p>

<p>I agreed, and we had one. It was not a moment
to refuse him creature comforts.</p>

<p>“I’m part of the concern,” he resumed, after a
large sip. “And jolly lucky to be, of course&mdash;I see
that. But it limits what one may call one’s independence.
It doesn’t matter a hang what you do,
Julius (This to me, London representative of Coldston’s!)&mdash;Oh,
privately, I mean, of course. But
with me, private life&mdash;well, family life, I mean&mdash;and
business are so infernally mixed up together.
Nina can’t absolutely give me the sack, but it would
be infernally inconvenient not to be on terms with
her.” He paused, and added impressively: “It
might in the end break up the business.”</p>

<p>One might as well think of breaking up the great
Pyramid or Mount Popocatepetl! Too large an order
even for an age of revolution!</p>

<p>“But you and Nina have nothing to quarrel
about,” I expostulated&mdash;dishonestly.</p>

<p>He eyed me, again smiling sourly. “Oh, come,
you know better than that!” his smile said, though
his tongue didn’t. “And, besides, it would upset
that idea that she and I talked over, and that rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
particularly attracted me. I think I spoke to you
about it? About Cragsfoot, you know.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard from Lady Dundrannan
lately?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not since I left the Villa.” He made this
admission rather sulkily.</p>

<p>“Ah, then you’re not up-to-date! Cragsfoot’s all
arranged. I’m to have it.” And I told him about
the family arrangement.</p>

<p>Here I must confess to a bit of malicious triumph.
The things envisaged itself to me as a fight between
Rillington and Frost, and Rillington had won.
Waldo’s old allegiance had resisted complete absorption.
But my feeling was&mdash;at the moment&mdash;rather
ungenerous; he was a good deal humbled already.</p>

<p>He took the disappointment very well. “Well,
it was a fancy of mine, but of course you ought to
have the first call, if Waldo sells out. So you’ll be
living at Cragsfoot after Sir Paget’s death?” He
appeared to ruminate over this prospect.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and I hope to be there a good deal of my
time, even before that.”</p>

<p>“With Nina and Waldo for your neighbors at
Briarmount?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Why not? What do you mean? I
shall see you there too sometimes, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll get on well with her.” He was
smiling still, though in a moody, malicious way&mdash;as
one is apt to smile when contemplating the difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
or vexations of others. “You and your family,”
he added the next moment. And with that
he rose from his chair. “No good asking you to
dine to-night, I suppose?” I shook my head. “No,
you’ll have to be on hand, of course! Well, good-by,
then. I’m off early to-morrow.” He held out his
hand. “It’ll interest Nina to hear about all this.”
He waved his hand round Venice, but no doubt he
referred especially to the death and burial of the
eminent Don Arsenio Valdez.</p>

<p>“Pray give her my best regards. Pave the way
for me as a neighbor, Godfrey!”</p>

<p>“Taking everything together, it’ll need a bit of
smoothing, perhaps.” He nodded to me, and
strolled away across the Piazza.</p>

<p>His words had given me material for a half-amused,
half-scared reflection&mdash;the mood which the
neighborhood of Lady Dundrannan&mdash;and much
more the possibility of any conflict with Lady Dundrannan&mdash;always
aroused in me. Sir Paget’s letter
had reflected&mdash;in a humor slightly spiced with restiveness&mdash;the
present relations between Cragsfoot
and Briarmount. What would they be with me in
residence, and presently in possession? With me
and my family there, as Godfrey Frost said? My
family which did not exist at present!</p>

<p>But I did not sit there reflecting. I paid for our
refreshments&mdash;Godfrey, in his preoccupation, had
omitted even to offer to do so&mdash;and went back to the
<i>palazzo</i>. Old Amedeo waylaid me in the hall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
told me that Donna Lucinda had requested me to
pay her a visit as soon as I returned from the funeral;
but he prevented me from obeying her invitation
for a few minutes. He was in a state of
exultation that had to find expression.</p>

<p>“Ah, what a funeral! You saw me there? No!
But I was, of course. A triumph! The name of
Valdez will stand high in Venice henceforth! Oh,
I don’t like Panizzi and that lot, any more than
Father Garcia does. My sympathies are clerical.
None the less, it was remarkable! Alas, what
wouldn’t Don Arsenio have done if he hadn’t been
cut off in his youth!”</p>

<p>That was a question which I felt&mdash;and feel&mdash;quite
incapable of answering, save in the most general
and non-committal terms. “Something astonishing!”
I said with a nod, as I dodged past the
broad barrier of Amedeo’s figure and succeeded in
reaching the staircase.</p>

<p>Right up to the top of the tall old house I had
to go this time&mdash;past Father Garcia and his noble
“Black” friends, past the scene of the banquet and
the scene of the catastrophe. I think that Lucinda
must have been listening for my steps; she opened
the door herself before I had time to knock on it.</p>

<p>She was back in the needlewoman’s costume now&mdash;her
black frock, with her shawl about her shoulders.
Perhaps this attire solved the problem of
mourning in the easiest way; or perhaps it was a
declaration of her intentions. I did not wait to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
ask myself that; the expression of her face caught
my immediate attention. It was one of irrepressible
amusement&mdash;of the eager amusement which seeks
to share itself with another appreciative soul. She
caught me by the hand, and drew me in, leading me
through the narrow passage to the door of her sitting
room&mdash;much of a replica of Arsenio’s on the
floor below, though the ceiling was less lofty and
the windows narrower.</p>

<p>Then I saw what had evoked the expression on
her face. Between the windows, propped up
against the discolored old hangings on the wall,
stood the largest wreath of <i>immortelles</i> which I have
ever seen on or off a grave, in or out of a shop window;
and, occupying about half of the interior of
the circle, there was a shield, or plaque, of purple
velvet&mdash;Oh, very sumptuous!&mdash;bearing an inscription
in large letters of gold:</p>

<p>“To the Illustrious Donna Lucinda Valdez and
to the Immortal Memory of the Illustrious Señor
Don Arsenio Valdez, the City and Citizens of Venice
offer Gratitude and Homage.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it&mdash;tremendous?” whispered Lucinda, her
arm now in mine.</p>

<p>“It certainly is some size,” I admitted, eyeing
the creation ruefully.</p>

<p>“No, no! The whole thing, I mean! Arsenio
himself! Oh, how I should like to tell them the
truth!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“The funeral too was&mdash;tremendous,” I remarked.
“But I suppose Amedeo’s told you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has! Also Father Garcia, who paid
me a visit of condolence. And a number of Arsenio’s
noble friends have sent condolences by stately,
seedy menservants. Oh, and those trustees have left
their cards, of course! Panizzi and the others!”</p>

<p>All this time we had been standing arm in arm,
opposite the portentous monument of grief, gratitude,
and homage. Now Lucinda withdrew her
hand from my arm, and sank into a chair.</p>

<p>“I’m having fame thrust upon me! I’m being
immortalized. The munificent widow of the munificent
Arsenio Valdez! I’m becoming a public character!
Oh, he is having his revenge on me, isn’t
he? Julius, I can’t stand it! I must fly from
Venice!”</p>

<p>My attention stuck on the monstrous wreath.
“What are you going to do with that?”</p>

<p>“I wonder if there would ever be a dark enough
night to tie a flat-iron to it, steal out with it round
our necks, and drop it in the Grand Canal!” Lucinda
speculated wistfully.</p>

<p class="pch">THE AIR ON THE COAST</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">“AND did a dark enough night ever come, Julius?”
Sir Paget asked with a chuckle.</p>

<p>It was late summer. I had arrived that
day to pay him a visit and, incidentally, to complete
the transaction by which Waldo was to convey
to me the reversion to Cragsfoot. My uncle and
I sat late together after dinner, while I regaled
him with the story of the last days of Arsenio Valdez&mdash;of
his luck, his death, and his glorification.</p>

<p>“Alas, sir, such things can’t actually happen in
this world. They’re dreams&mdash;Platonic ideas laid up
in heaven&mdash;inward dispositions towards things
which can’t be literally translated into action! We
did it in our souls. But, no; the wreath doesn’t, in
bare and naked fact, lie at the bottom of the Grand
Canal. It hangs proudly in the hall of Palazzo
Valdez, the apple of his eye to fat old Amedeo, with
whom Lucinda left it in charge&mdash;a pledge never
likely to be demanded back&mdash;when she leased the
<i>palazzo</i> to him. He undertakes the upkeep and
expenses, pays her about two hundred a year for
it, and expects to do very well by letting out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
apartments. He considers that the wreath will add
prestige to the place and enhance its letting value.
Besides, he’s genuinely very proud of it, and the
Valdez legend loses nothing in his hands, I assure
you.”</p>

<p>“It’s a queer story. And that’s the end of it, is
it? Because it’s nearly six months since our friend
the Monkey, as you boys used to call him, played
his last throw&mdash;and won!”</p>

<p>“There’s very little more to tell. As you know,
Sir Ezekiel’s death sent me on my travels once
again&mdash;to the States and South America; I was
appointed Managing Director, and had to go inspecting,
and reorganizing, and so forth. That’s
all settled. I’m established now in town&mdash;and here,
thank God, I am&mdash;at old Cragsfoot again!”</p>

<p>“You’ve certainly been a good deal mixed up in
the affair&mdash;by fate or choice,” he said, smiling, “but
you’re not the hero, are you? Arsenio claims that
<i>rôle</i>! Or the heroine! What of her, Julius?”</p>

<p>“She came back to England four or five months
ago. She’s living in rooms at Hampstead. She’s
got the <i>palazzo</i> rent, and she still does her needlework;
she gets along pretty comfortably.”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen her since you came back, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, pretty nearly every day,” I answered. “She
was the first person I went to see when I got back
to London; she was the last person I saw before I
left London this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat rubbing his hands together, and looking
into the bright fire of logs that his old body found
pleasant now, even on summer evenings; the wind
blows cold off the sea very often at Cragsfoot.</p>

<p>“You’re telling me the end of the story now,
aren’t you, Julius?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope and think so. Indeed, why shouldn’t
I say that I know it? I think that we both knew
from the hour of Arsenio’s death. We had been
too much together&mdash;too close in spirit through it all&mdash;for
anything else. How could we say good-by
and go our separate ways after all that? It would
have seemed to us both utterly unnatural. First,
my head had grown full of her&mdash;in those talks at
Ste. Maxime that I told you we’d had; and, when
a woman’s concerned, the heart’s apt to follow the
head, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder at either head or heart. She was
a delightful child; she seems to have grown into a
beautiful woman&mdash;yes, she would have&mdash;and one
that might make a man think about her. There
was nothing between you while he lived? No, I
don’t ask that question, I’ve no right to&mdash;and, I
think, no need to.”</p>

<p>“With her there couldn’t have been; it was as impossible
as it proved in the end for her to marry
Waldo. For her it was a virtue in me that I
knew it.”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t married to Arsenio Valdez when she
ran away from Waldo?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>“In her own eyes she was, and when he called her&mdash;called
her back&mdash;well, she had to go.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’ve sometimes fancied that there might
have been some untold history like that.”</p>

<p>“She now wishes that you and Waldo&mdash;just you
two&mdash;should know that there was. Will you tell
him, sir? I’d rather not. She thinks it may make
you and him feel more gently to her; she’s proud
herself, you know, and was sorry to wound others
in their pride.”</p>

<p>“It’s generous of her. I’ll tell him&mdash;what I
must; and you need tell me no more than you have.
I shouldn’t wonder if the idea isn’t quite new to
him either. There are&mdash;quarters&mdash;from which
something of the sort may have been suggested, eh,
Julius?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing as to that, but, as you say, it’s
very possible. You’ll have gathered how the feelings
of these two ladies towards one another runs
through the whole business. And we’re not finished
with them yet. Before Waldo sets his hand to that
agreement, he must know that the arrangement
which is to bring me to Cragsfoot will bring Lucinda
there too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, as its mistress; even in my lifetime, if she
so pleases; after me, in any case.” He looked across
to me, smiling. “And the moment so difficult&mdash;the
more difficult because it’s otherwise so triumphant!
The Heir-Apparent is born&mdash;a month ago&mdash;I wrote
you about it. The dynasty is assured; Her Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
is at her grandest and&mdash;I will add&mdash;her most gracious.
I saw her about again for the first time the
day before yesterday, and she said to me, ‘Now I’m
really content, Sir Paget!’&mdash;implying, as it seemed
to me, that the subject world ought to be content
also. All the Court was there&mdash;the Heir itself,
our dear old Prince Consort, the Grand Vizier&mdash;forgive
me mixing East and West, but that seems to
be the sort of position which she assigns to young
Godfrey Frost; an exalted but precarious position,
with a throne on one hand, and a bowstring on the
other! Oh, yes, and there was a Lady-in-Waiting
into the bargain, a pretty girl called Eunice Something-or-other.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she was at Villa San Carlo&mdash;Eunice Unthank,”
said I, smiling. Nina&mdash;pertinacious as a
limpet!</p>

<p>“And now we’re to come breaking in on this
benevolent despotism! Our schemes border on conspiracy,
don’t they?” He grew graver, though he
still smiled whimsically. “A reconciliation possible?”
he suggested doubtfully.</p>

<p>I laughed. “There’s a crowning task for your
diplomacy, Sir Paget!”</p>

<p>“If I could change the hearts of women, I should
be a wizard, not a diplomatist. Their feuds have a
grand implacability beside which the quarrels of
nations are trivial and transient affairs. In this
matter, I’m a broken reed&mdash;don’t lean upon me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Julius! And could you answer for your side&mdash;for
your fair belligerent?”</p>

<p>“Lucinda makes war by laughing,” said I, laughing
myself. “But&mdash;well, I think she would go on
laughing, you know.”</p>

<p>“Just what my Lady Dundrannan always hates,
and occasionally suspects&mdash;even in me!”</p>

<p>“I wish to blazes that Waldo would have one of
his old rages, and tell her it’s not her business!”</p>

<p>“I daresay he may wish you hadn’t taken so much
interest in his runaway <i>fiancée</i>,” was Sir Paget’s pertinent
retort. “No, he’ll have no rages; like you,
I sometimes regret it. If she vetoes, he’ll submit.”
He shook his head. “Here are we poor men up
against these grand implacabilities; they transcend
our understanding and mock our efforts. Even Arsenio,
the great Arsenio, though he made use of
them, tripped up over them in the end! What can
you and I, and poor Waldo, do?” He got up.
“I’ll write a line to Waldo on the point&mdash;on the two
points&mdash;to-night; and send it up by the car to-morrow;
he can let us know his answer before Stannard
is due here, with the deeds, in the afternoon. There
might even be time to telephone and stop him from
starting, if the answer’s a veto!”</p>

<p>Diplomatist though Sir Paget was, man of affairs
as I must assume myself to be&mdash;or where stands the
firm of Coldston’s?&mdash;our judgments were clumsy,
our insight at fault; we did no justice to the fine
quality of Lady Dundrannan’s pride. It was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
to be outdone by the pride of the needlewoman of
Cimiez&mdash;outwardly, at all events; and do not many
tell us that wholly to conquer, or even conceal, such
emotions as fear and self-distrust is a moral triumph,
where not to feel them is a mere fluke of nature&mdash;just
the way one happens to be concocted? The
only answer that came to Sir Paget’s no doubt very
delicately, diplomatically expressed note, came over
the telephone (Sir Paget had not trusted its secrecy!),
from butler to butler. Marsden at Briarmount
told Critcher at Cragsfoot that he was to inform
Sir Paget that Colonel Rillington said it
was all right about this afternoon. Critcher delivered
the message as Sir Paget and I were sitting
in the garden before lunch&mdash;on that bench by the
garden door whereon Lucinda had once sat, listening
fearfully to the quarrel of angry youths.</p>

<p>“Very well, Critcher,” said Sir Paget indifferently.
But when the man had gone, he turned to me and
said, with a tremor in his voice, “So you can come,
you see&mdash;you and Lucinda, Julius.” I had not
known till then how much he wanted us. “I say,
what would poor old Aunt Bertha have said? She
went over, bag and baggage!”</p>

<p>“She’d have come back&mdash;with the same <i>impedimenta</i>,”
I declared, laughing.</p>

<p>There was a stateliness in Lady Dundrannan’s
assent, given by her presence and countenance to the
arrangement which the allied family of the Rillingtons
had&mdash;well, I suppose Waldo had&mdash;submitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
to her approval. The big Briarmount car&mdash;even
bigger, more newly yellow, than the car of Cimiez&mdash;brought
down the whole bunch&mdash;all the Court, as
Sir Paget had called it. Briarmount’s approval
was almost overwhelmingly signified. It was not,
of course, the thing to mention Lucinda&mdash;that was
unofficial; perhaps, moreover, slightly shameful.
Godfrey, at least, wore an embarrassed air which
the ostensible character of the occasion did not warrant;
and little Lady Eunice&mdash;I suspected that the
information had filtered down to her through the
other three of them&mdash;seemed to look at me with
something of the reproachful admiration one reserves
for a dare-devil. Waldo, for his part, gave
my hand a hard, though surreptitious, squeeze,
smiling into my eyes with his old kindness, somehow
conveying an immense deal to me about how he for
his part felt about the implacabilities, and the way
they had affected his life&mdash;and now mine. Of
course I was myself in the mood to perceive&mdash;to
exaggerate, or even to imagine&mdash;such thoughts in
him; but there it was&mdash;his eyes traveled from my
face to his lady’s shapely back (she was putting Mr.
Stannard, the lawyer, at his ease&mdash;he was a cadet of
an old county family, and one of the best known
sportsmen in the neighborhood), and back to my
face again, and&mdash;well, certainly the situation was
not lost on Waldo. But it was only after our business
was finished&mdash;a short recital of the effect of the
deeds from Stannard&mdash;didn’t we know more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
he did about that? But no doubt it was proper&mdash;and
then the signatures (“Dundrannan” witnessing
in a fine, bold, decisive hand!)&mdash;that he said a word
to me. “God give you and yours happiness with
the old place, Julius!” The pang of parting from
it spoke there, as well as kindliness and forgiveness
for us.</p>

<p>Sir Paget insisted&mdash;certainly not to the displeasure
of Mr. Stannard&mdash;on “wetting the signatures”
with a bottle of his Pommery 1900. Nina
just wetted her lips&mdash;even to that vintage she could
condescend. Then we all strolled out into the
garden, while tea was preparing. There was the
old place&mdash;the high cliffs above it, one narrow
wooded ledge fronting the sea; scant acres, but, as
it were, with all our blood in them. I felt like a
usurper (in spite of the honest money that I was
paying), the younger branch ousting the elder, even
through an abdication. But I was a usurper happy
and content&mdash;as, I daresay, they often are, in spite
of the poets and the dramatists. Sir Paget and
Stannard paired off; Godfrey and Eunice; Waldo
sat down on the bench by the door and lit his pipe;
I found myself left with Nina Dundrannan. With
the slightest motion of her hand she invited me to
accompany her along the walk towards the shrubbery.
At once I knew that she meant to say something
to me, though I had not the least idea on what
lines her speech might run. She could be very candid&mdash;had
she not been once, long ago, she the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
“skeleton at the feast”? She could also put the
truth very decisively in its proper place&mdash;a remote
one. Fires burnt in her&mdash;I knew that; but who
could tell when the flames would show?</p>

<p>There was a seat placed where a gap in the trees
gave a view of the sea; here we sat down together.
With her usual resoluteness she began at once with
what she had made up her mind to say.</p>

<p>“Waldo didn’t show me Sir Paget’s note, but he
told me a piece of news about you which it gave
him; he gave me to understand that you and Sir
Paget thought that I, as well as he himself, should
know it. He told me that the arrangement was no
longer repugnant to his own feelings, although it
once would have been; he felt both able and willing
to ignore the past, and start afresh on terms of
friendship with Madame Valdez&mdash;with Lucinda.
He asked me what my feelings were. I said that
in my view that was hardly the question; I had married
into the Rillington family; any lady whom Sir
Paget and he, the heads of the family, were prepared
to accept and welcome as a member of it, would, as
a matter of course, be accepted by me; I should treat
her, whenever we met, with courtesy, as I should no
doubt be treated by her; a great degree of affection,
I reminded Waldo, was not essential or invariable
between relations-in-law.” Here Lady Dundrannan
smiled for a moment. “Least of all should I
desire that any supposed feelings of mine should interfere
with the family arrangement about Cragsfoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
which you all three felt to be desirable; the
more so as it had in a way originated with myself,
since, if I had wished to make this place our principal
residence, the present plan would never have been
thought of at all. So I told him to put me entirely
out of the question; he would be quite safe in feeling
sure that I should accept the situation with a good
grace.”</p>

<p>She paused, and I took occasion to say: “I think
we’re all much indebted to you&mdash;and myself most of
all. Any other attitude on your part would have
upset an arrangement which I have come to have
very much at heart. I’m grateful to you, Nina.”</p>

<p>“You know a great deal&mdash;indeed, you probably
know pretty well everything&mdash;that has happened between
Lucinda and me. You wouldn’t defend all
that she did; I don’t defend all I did. When I’m
challenged, I fight, and I suppose Jonathan Frost’s
daughter isn’t dainty as to her weapons&mdash;that’s
your point of view about me, anyhow, isn’t it?
You’ve always been in her camp. You’ve always
been a critic of me.”</p>

<p>“Really I’ve regretted the whole&mdash;er&mdash;difficulty
and&mdash;well, difference, very much.”</p>

<p>“You’ve laughed at it even more than you’ve regretted
it, I think,” she remarked drily. “But I’ve
liked you better than you’ve liked me&mdash;though you
did laugh at me&mdash;and I’m not going to make things
difficult or uncomfortable for you. When I accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
a state of things, I accept it without reservation.
I don’t want to go on digging pins in.”</p>

<p>“If I have ever smiled&mdash;as you accuse me of
having done&mdash;as well as regretted, it was because I
saw your qualities as well as hers. The battle was
well joined. You’ve both had your defeats and
your victories. I should like you to be friends
now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe you would; that’s why I’m talking
like this to you. But”&mdash;her voice took on a sudden
ring of strong feeling&mdash;“it’s impossible. There are
such memories between us.”</p>

<p>I did not urge the point; it would be useless with
her, very likely also with Lucinda. I let it go with a
shrug.</p>

<p>She sat for a moment in the stately composed
silence that so well became her.</p>

<p>“It’s probable that we shall divide our time mainly
between London, Dundrannan, and Villa San
Carlo in future. It’s even likely that if Godfrey
settles matters with Eunice Unthank, as I think he
will, he’ll take a lease of Briarmount. That would
not be disagreeable to you, would it?”</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world,” I answered, smiling.
“I like them both very much.”</p>

<p>She turned to me with a bland and simple sincerity
of manner. “The doctor thinks that the air
on this coast is too strong for baby.”</p>

<p>I seemed to be hearing an official bulletin&mdash;or
<i>communiqué</i>, as for some occult reason&mdash;or pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
love of jargon&mdash;they used to call it. There was no
question of a reverse at the hands of the enemy;
but climatic conditions rendered further operations
undesirable; the withdrawal was being effected voluntarily,
in perfect order, and without loss. That
the enemy was taking possession of the evacuated
territory was a circumstance of no military significance
whatever&mdash;though, to be sure, it might make
some little difference to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>“It won’t do to run any risks with that precious
boy!” I observed, with an approving smile, and (as
I flatter myself) with just the artistic shade of jocosity&mdash;as
if I were gently chaffing her on a genuine
but exaggerated maternal solicitude.</p>

<p>“Well, when the doctor says that, what can one
do?” asked Lady Dundrannan.</p>

<p>“Oh, one must follow his advice, of course!” I
murmured, with a nod of my head.</p>

<p>The bark of our conversation (another metaphor
may well be employed to illustrate her skill) being
thus piloted through the shoals of truth into the calm
deep waters of humbug, its voyage ended prosperously.
“I should never forgive myself, and Waldo
would never forgive me, if I took the slightest risk,”
Nina concluded, as she rose from the seat.</p>

<p>But as we stood there, facing one another&mdash;before
we began to stroll back to the house&mdash;as we
stood facing one another, all alone, we allowed ourselves
one little relapse into reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think of being off soon?” I asked, with
a smile.</p>

<p>She gave me one sharp glance and a contemptuous
smile. “Before your wedding&mdash;whenever that may
be, Julius!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">IN FIVE YEARS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WINTER had set in again when Lucinda
and I came together to Cragsfoot. The
picture of her on her first evening there
stands out vivid in my memory.</p>

<p>Sir Paget had received her with affectionate, but
perhaps somewhat ceremonious, courtesy; there was
a touch of ratifying a treaty of peace in his manner.
She was minded to come closer in intimacy; for in
these recent days&mdash;before and just after our wedding&mdash;a
happy confidence seemed to possess her. Self-defense
and the hardness it has to carry with it
were necessary to her no longer; she reached out
more freely for love and friendship, and broke the
bounds of that thoughtful isolation which had so
often served to keep the woman herself apart from
all about her. She was not on guard now; that was
the meaning of the change which had come over her;
not on guard and not fighting.</p>

<p>After dinner she drew a low stool up beside the
old man’s big armchair before the fire, and sat down
beside him, laying one arm across his knees; I sat
smoking on the other side of the hearth. Sir Paget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
laid his hand on hers for a moment, as though to
welcome her bodily presence thus in touch with him.</p>

<p>“You’ll be wondering how it happened,” she began,
“and Julius won’t have been able to tell you.
Probably it never occurred to him to try, though I
suppose he’s told you all the actual happenings&mdash;the
outward things, I mean, you know. It was at
Ste. Maxime that we&mdash;began to be ‘we’ to one
another. I knew it in him then&mdash;perhaps sooner
than he did&mdash;but I don’t know; he’s still rather
secretive about himself, though intolerably inquisitive
about other people. But I did know it in him;
and I searched, and found it in myself&mdash;not love
then, but a feeling of partnership, of alliance. I
was very lonely then. Well, I can stand that. I
was standing it; and I could have gone on&mdash;perhaps!
I wonder if I could! No, not after I found out
about Arsenio’s taking that money! That would
have broken me&mdash;if it hadn’t been for Ste. Maxime.”</p>

<p>She paused for a moment; when she spoke again,
she addressed me&mdash;on the other side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>“You went away for a long while; but you remembered
and you wrote. I’m not a letter-writer,
and that was really the reason I didn’t answer. I
have to be with people&mdash;to feel them&mdash;if I’m to
talk with them to any purpose&mdash;to ask then questions
and get answers, even though they don’t say
anything.” (I saw her fingers bend in a light pressure
on old Sir Paget’s knee.) “I should have
sounded stupid in my letters. Or said too much!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Because the only thing was to say nothing about it,
wasn’t it? You knew that as well as I did, didn’t
you? If once we had talked&mdash;in letters or when
you came back&mdash;&mdash;! I did nearly talk when you
suddenly appeared there on the Piazza at Venice.
It was pretty nearly as good as a declaration, wasn’t
it, Julius?”</p>

<p>She gave a low merry laugh; but then her eyes
wandered from my face to the blaze of the fire,
and took on their self-questioning look.</p>

<p>“I think it’s rare to be able to see the humor of
things all by yourself&mdash;I mean, of course, of close
things, things very near to you, things that hurt, although
they’re really funny. You want a sympathizer&mdash;somebody
to laugh with. Oh, well, it goes
deeper than that! You want to feel that there’s
another world outside the miserable little one you’re
living in&mdash;outside it, different from it&mdash;a place
where you yourself can be different from the sort of
creature which the life you’re leading forces you to
be&mdash;at least, unless you’re a saint, I suppose; and I
never was that! You want a City of Refuge for
your heart, don’t you, Sir Paget? For your heart,
and your feelings; yes, and your humor; for everything
that you are or that you’ve got, and want to
go on being or having. Because the worst thing
that anybody or any state of things can do to you,
or threaten you with, is the destruction of yourself&mdash;whether
it’s done by assault or by starvation! In
the world I lived in&mdash;the actual one as it had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
to be for Arsenio and me&mdash;I was done for! There
was hardly anything left of me!” She suddenly
turned her face up to Sir Paget, with a murmur of
laughter. “It was like the Cheshire cat! Nothing
left but a grin and claws! A grin for his antics,
claws to protect myself. That’s what I had come
to in my own world&mdash;the little world of Arsenio and
me! Claws and a grin&mdash;wasn’t I, Julius?”</p>

<p>“I would not hear your enemy say so, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You know it’s true; I knew at the time that you
felt it, but I couldn’t alter myself. Well, I told you
something about it at Venice&mdash;trying to change, not
succeeding! Even his love for me had become one
more offense in him&mdash;and that was bad. The only
thing that carried me through was the other world
you gave me&mdash;outside my own; where you were,
where he wasn’t&mdash;though we looked at him from it,
and had to!&mdash;where I could take refuge!”</p>

<p>She went on slowly, reflectively, as though she
were compelled reluctantly to render an account to
herself. “I have escaped; I have gained my City of
Refuge. But I bear the marks of my imprisonment&mdash;even
as my hands here bear the marks of my work&mdash;of
my sewing and washing and ironing. I’m
marked and scarred!”</p>

<p>Sir Paget laid his hand on hers again. “We keep
a salve for those wounds at Cragsfoot,” he said
gently. “We’ve stored it up abundantly for you,
Lucinda.”</p>

<p>She turned to him, now clasping his arms with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
hands. “You! Yet I put you to shame; I betrayed
you; I was false&mdash;Oh, and cruel to Waldo!” For
the first time in all my knowledge of her I saw tears
running down her cheeks. Sir Paget took her hands
into his and kissed her upturned face.</p>

<p>“Waldo’s as happy as a king&mdash;or, at least, a
Prince Consort,” he said, smiling, though I think
that his voice shook a little. “And, since it’s an evening
of penitence and confession, I’ll make my confession
too. I’ve always been a bit of a traitor, or a
rebel, myself. You know it well enough, Julius!”
He smiled. “Sitting here, under the sway of Briarmount,
I’m afraid that I have, before now, drunk a
silent toast to the Queen over the Water. Because
I remembered you in old days, my dear.”</p>

<p>The mention of Briarmount brought the smiles
back to Lucinda’s face. She rose from her stool
and stood on the hearthrug between us, looking from
one to the other. She gave a defiant toss of her
fair head. “Guilty, my lords! I can’t abide her.
And I’m glad&mdash;yes, I am&mdash;that she’s not here at
Cragsfoot!”</p>

<p>“Moreover, she has retreated even from Briarmount
before you,” chuckled Sir Paget.</p>

<p>“When I advanced in strength, she always retreated,”
said Lucinda with another toss. “The
fact is&mdash;I had the least bit more effrontery. I could
bluff her, whatever was in my heart. She couldn’t
bluff me.”</p>

<p>“Reconciliation, I suppose, impossible?” hazarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the diplomatist <i>en ratraite</i>, not able to resist the
temptation of plying his trade, of getting round the
grand implacability; what a feather in his cap it
would be!</p>

<p>“Looking down the vista of years,” said Lucinda,
now gayly triumphant in her mastery over the pair
of us, “a thing I used to do, Julius, oftener than I
need now&mdash;I see two old ladies, basking somewhere
in the sun&mdash;perchance at Villa San Carlo&mdash;which I
have not, up to now, visited, though I know the surrounding
district. From under their wigs, in old
squeaky voices&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I thank God for my mortality,” murmured old
Sir Paget as he looked at her.</p>

<p>“They’re telling one another that they must both
of them have been very wonderful, clever, attractive,
beautiful! Or else they’d never have made so much
trouble, and never squabbled so much. And I
shouldn’t wonder if they said&mdash;both of them&mdash;that
nothing in the whole business was their fault at all;
it was only the men who were so silly. But then
they made the men silly. What men wouldn’t they
make silly, when they were young and beautiful so
long ago?”</p>

<p>“How much of this is Lady Dundrannan&mdash;and
how much more is you?”</p>

<p>“Mostly me, Julius. Because I have, as I told
you, the least bit more effrontery. But her ladyship
agrees, and the two old gossips sip their tea and
mumble their toast, with all the harmony and happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
of superannuated sinners. I’m sure I needn’t
explain that feeling to men&mdash;they knew all about
it!”</p>

<p>“This picture, distant though it is, saps my conception
of Lady Dundrannan,” I protested. “Perhaps
of you too; do you mind if I call you a good
hater?”</p>

<p>A smile hung about her lips; but her voice passed
from the gay to the gentle, and the old inward-looking
gaze took possession of her eyes. “No, I
don’t mind, I like my hatreds; even for me there
never failed to be something amusing in them. I
wonder if I do myself too much credit in saying&mdash;something
unreal? Did I play parts&mdash;like poor
Arsenio? But still they seemed very real, and they
kept my courage up. I suppose it’s funny to think
that one behaves well&mdash;honorably&mdash;sometimes, just
to spite somebody else. I’m afraid it is so, though&mdash;isn’t
it, Sir Paget?”</p>

<p>“The Pharisee in the Temple comes somewhere
near your notion.”</p>

<p>She came and sat herself down on the arm of my
chair, and threw her arm round my neck. “Yes,
hatreds serve their turn. But they ought to die;
being of the earth earthy, they ought to, oughtn’t
they? And they do. Do any of us here hate poor
Arsenio now?” Suddenly she kissed me. “You
never did, because you’re so ridiculously understanding&mdash;and
I thank you for that now, because it
helped me to try not to, to try to remember that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
loved me, and that he couldn’t help being what he
was. But where’s all my anger gone? Why, you
and I often talk of him, and enjoy his tricks, don’t
we? They can’t hurt us now; they’re just amusing,
and we’re grateful to the poor man, and don’t feel
hard to him any more, do we?” She fell silent for
a moment, and then, with a broader smile, and with
one hand uplifted in the air, she said, “And so, Sir
Paget, very, very dear Sir Paget, I back myself
to make friends with Nina in&mdash;well, say five years!”</p>

<p>The prudently calculated audacity of this undertaking
made us laugh. “And with Waldo&mdash;how
soon?” asked Sir Paget.</p>

<p>“Oh, to-morrow! But if I do that, I must take
ten years, instead of five, for Nina!”</p>

<p>“You’d better arrange the time-table in your own
way, my dear,” Sir Paget admitted discreetly.
“Now I’ll go off to bed and leave you to have a talk
together.”</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and advanced towards her,
to give her his good-night greeting. Quicker than
he was, she met him almost before he had taken a
step. Catching his hands in hers, she fell on her
knees before him. “Have you a blessing left for
the sinner that repenteth&mdash;for your prodigal
daughter?”</p>

<p>She was not in tears now, nor near them. She
was just wonderfully and exultantly coaxing.</p>

<p>The old man disengaged his hands, clasped her
face with them, turned it up to him, and gallantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
kissed it. “Your sunshine warms my old bones,” he
said. “I’m glad you’re back at Cragsfoot, Lucinda.”
He turned away quickly and left us.</p>

<p>I went to her and raised her from her knees.</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” she said, with a tremulous but
satisfied little laugh. “And I love him even more
than I’ve tried to make him love me&mdash;and that’s
saying a good deal to you, who’ve seen me practice
my wiles! Are the tricks stale to you, Julius?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Try some new ones!”</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re cunning! The old ones are, I believe&mdash;I
do believe&mdash;good enough for you.”</p>

<p>“The new ones had better be for Nina!”</p>

<p>“In five years, Julius, as sure as I live&mdash;and love
you!”</p>

<p>“How do you propose to begin?” I asked skeptically.
I knew my Nina! I knew Lucinda. It
seemed, at the best, a very even bet whether she
could bring it off.</p>

<p>Lucinda laughed in merry confidence and mockery.
“Why, by giving her to understand that you make
me thoroughly unhappy, of course. How else
would you do it?”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
